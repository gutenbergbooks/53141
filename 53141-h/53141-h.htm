<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The publication of this revised and extended edition of
the Guide to the Zoological Park is necessary in order to
bring our most important collections down to date. With
the completion of the Zebra House and Eagle Aviary, we
are now able to offer a Guide Book to the Zoological Park
as practically finished.</p>
<p>The visitor is not to understand, however, that with the
completion of the features named above nothing more will
remain to be done. An institution of this kind never
reaches a state of absolute completion, with no further
possibilities of improvement. But the building of boundary
walls, and the rebuilding of temporary entrances, are matters
of small moment in comparison with the completion of
a grand series of installations for animals, and buildings
for public comfort.</p>
<p>Few indeed are the persons who know, or who ever will
know, the extent to which both the general design and the
details of the Zoological Park have been originated, and
hammered out of the raw materials. From the inception
of the undertaking, the work of development has involved
a continuous struggle to meet new conditions. Although
precedents and models for things to be done were sought
far and wide, in all save a very few instances, our needs
were so peculiar, and so different from those of other
zoological gardens and parks, we have found really very
little that we could copy. The abundant-room idea on
which the Zoological Park was founded, and our desire for
the full utilization of the works of nature, have from the
first taxed the creative faculties of the Society to the utmost.</p>
<p>It has been gratifying to find in other zoological establishments
a number of features which we could utilize here,
thereby saving ourselves something in the eternal grind of
invention and experiment, and we have gladly made prominent
mention of such cases.</p>
<p>While it is possible to complete the equipment of animal
installations for a Zoological Park, and fill them with fine
collections, the demand for more animals is continuous.
Our wild creatures are not immortal; and, like human beings,
they live out their allotted lives and pass away. The
great majority do not perpetuate themselves in captivity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
and the depleted ranks must be filled by new gifts and
new purchases. Gifts of specimens, and funds for purchases,
must constantly be forthcoming.</p>
<p>In the acquisition of certain representative species of
great variety but particular desirability, the Society has
been much favored by its friends, both at home and abroad.
Frequently it happens that the greatest zoological rarities
are obtainable only through the good will and tireless industry
of friends who travel into the most remote and inaccessible
regions of the earth. It is to such sources that we
owe our musk-ox herd, walrus, mountain goat herd, spectacled
bear and many other species.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee makes grateful acknowledgment
of the loyal and generous support it has constantly
received from the Board of Managers, the members of
the Zoological Society, and from the Government of the
City of New York. Thanks to a judicious union of these
forces, the development of the Zoological Park has gone
forward rapidly and satisfactorily. Although the actual
period of construction has been remarkably short for so vast
an undertaking, everything constructed is of the most permanent
character. It is only just to note the fact that
while the Zoological Park is an institution of national interest
and importance, and free to all the world, with the
exception of a few gifts of animals it has been created and
is maintained wholly by the citizens of the City of New
York. The State has contributed nothing.</p>

<h2 id="c3">GENERAL STATUS
<br />OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK.</h2>
<p><b>Origin.</b>&mdash;The New York Zoological Park originated with
the New York Zoological Society, a scientific body incorporated
in 1895, under a special charter granted by the
Legislature of the State of New York. The declared objects
of the Society are three in number&mdash;&ldquo;A public Zoological
Park; the preservation of our native animals; the promotion
of zoology.&rdquo; The Society has enrolled among its various
classes over 2,000 members.</p>
<p>Henry Fairfield Osborn is the President of the Society.
The affairs of the Society are managed by a Board of Managers
of thirty-six persons, which meets three times each
year. The planning and general development of the Zoological
Society is in the hands of an Executive Committee
of eight members, as follows: Madison Grant, Chairman;
Percy R. Pyne, Samuel Thorne, William White Niles, Watson
B. Dickerman, Wm. Pierson Hamilton, Frank K. Sturgis,
Lispenard Stewart and Henry Fairfield Osborn, <i>ex-officio</i>.
Madison Grant, the Chairman of the Executive Committee,
is also Secretary of the Society, and his office is at No. 11
Wall Street. Dr. William T. Hornaday is the Director and
General Curator of the Zoological Park, and his office is now
located in the Administration Building on Baird Court. The
address is 185th Street and Southern Boulevard. The Society
assumed control of the grounds on July 1, 1898, and
began the first excavation, for the Bird House, on August
11th. The Park Department began work, on the Wild-Fowl
Pond, on August 29, 1898.</p>
<p><b>Sources of Income.</b>&mdash;The funds devoted to the development
of the Zoological Park have been derived from the
following sources:</p>
<p>1. From the Zoological Society, obtained by subscriptions
from private citizens&mdash;funds for plans, for the erection of
buildings, aviaries, dens and other accommodations for
animals; and for the purchase of animals.</p>
<p>2. From the City of New York&mdash;by vote of the Board of
Estimate and Apportionment&mdash;funds for the construction of
walks, roads, sewers and drainage, water supply, public comfort
buildings, entrances, grading, excavating of large ponds
and lakes, annual maintenance, and also for animal buildings.</p>

<p class="pcap">SKETCH MAP SHOWING LOCATION OF ZOOLOGICAL PARK.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The Zoological Society has expended, of its own funds,
for plans, construction and live animals, over $641,000. This
sum has been derived from its special subscription fund, and
from the annual dues and fees of its members.</p>
<p><b>Privileges.</b>&mdash;Because of the fact that the Zoological Society
has undertaken to furnish all the animals for the Zoological
Park, the City of New York has agreed that all the
revenue-producing privileges of the Park shall be controlled
by the Society. <i>All net profits</i> derived from the restaurants,
boats, refreshments, riding animals, the sale of photographs,
books, etc., and all admission fees, are expended by the
Society <i>in the purchase of animals for the Park</i>. It is well
that visitors should know that <i>all net profits realized in
the Park go directly toward the increase of the animal collections</i>.</p>
<p>The Society maintains a supply of boats for hire, and
riding animals of various kinds for the amusement of children.</p>
<p><b>Location.</b>&mdash;The Zoological Park is the geographical center
of that portion of Greater New York now known as
Bronx County. From east to west it is half-way between
the Hudson River and Long Island Sound, and from north
to south it is midway between the mouth of the Harlem
River and Mount Vernon. From the City Hall to the Reptile
House the distance is eleven miles. The distance by automobile
from the Central Park Plaza to the Concourse Entrance
is 9&frac12; miles. The Northwest Entrance is about half a
mile from Fordham station on the Harlem Railway.</p>
<p>The area of the Park is 264 acres, divided as follows:</p>

<h3 id="c4">MEANS OF ACCESS.</h3>
<p><b>Via the Subway, to the Boston Road Entrance.</b>&mdash;The terminus
of the eastern branch of the Subway, at &ldquo;180th St.,
Zoological Park,&rdquo; lands visitors at the southeastern entrances
to the Zoological Park, at West Farms. Visitors
from points below 96th Street must be careful to board the
&ldquo;Bronx Park&rdquo; trains, and not the &ldquo;Broadway&rdquo; trains.</p>
<p><b>Routes for Automobiles or Carriages.</b>&mdash;Via Central Park,
Lenox Avenue, Macomb&rsquo;s Dam Bridge and Jerome Avenue
or Grand Concourse to Pelham Avenue, thence eastward to
the Concourse Entrance, where motor cars and carriages are
admitted to the Park.</p>
<p><b>Via the Third Avenue Elevated.</b>&mdash;The Third Avenue Elevated
Railway has been extended to Bedford Park, and
visitors coming to the Zoological Park on it or on the Harlem
Railroad should alight at Fordham Station, from which
the northwest entrance is half a mile distant, due eastward,
on Pelham Avenue, via the Union Railway surface cars.</p>
<p><b>Surface Cars.</b>&mdash;The Southern Boulevard and the Zoological
Park Cars of the Union Railway now run to both
the Crotona (Southwest) Entrance and the Fordham Entrance.
The Crosstown cars of the same line intersect the
Southern Boulevard three blocks south of the Crotona
Entrance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c5">ADMISSION.</h3>
<p><b>Free Admission.</b>&mdash;On all holidays, and on Sunday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, the Zoological Park
is open free to the public.</p>
<p><b>Pay Admission.</b>&mdash;On every Monday and Thursday, save
when either of those days falls on a holiday, all members of
the Zoological Society who surrender coupons from their
membership tickets, and all other persons holding tickets
from the Society, will be admitted free. All other persons
seeking admission will be admitted on payment of twenty-five
cents for each adult, and fifteen cents for each child
under twelve years of age. Tickets are sold only at the
entrance gates.</p>
<p><b>Holidays on Pay Days.</b>&mdash;Whenever a legal holiday falls
on a Monday or Thursday, admission to the Park will be
free on that day.</p>
<p><b>Hours for Opening and Closing.</b>&mdash;From May 1st to November
1st the gates will be opened at 9 A. M. daily, and
closed half an hour before sunset. From November 1st to
May 1st the gates will open at 10 A. M.</p>
<p><b>Entrances, Walks, etc.</b>&mdash;The portion of the Zoological
Park situated west of the Boston Road has been enclosed.
Access to this area is provided by six entrances, one situated
at each corner&mdash;one on the Boston Road and one at the
bridge on Pelham Avenue. The latter is a carriage entrance
for visitors wishing to drive to the north end of Baird
Court. From all these entrances broad walks lead into the
Park and through it, reaching all the collections of animals
now installed.</p>
<p><b>Carriage Roads.</b>&mdash;The only wagon road which enters the
central portion of the Park now occupied by animals is the
Service Road, which enters from the Southern Boulevard,
at 185th Street, and runs eastward, to the Service Building,
Reptile House, Bear Dens, and Rocking Stone Restaurant.</p>
<p><i>This road is for business purposes only</i>, and is not open for
the vehicles of visitors. It is utterly impossible to admit
carriages to the <i>center</i> of the Park, save those of officers
entering on business, and <i>visitors must not ask for exceptions
to this very necessary rule</i>.</p>
<p><b>Automobile and Carriage Entrance.</b>&mdash;A fine public carriage
road and concourse, leading from Pelham Avenue
Bridge and to the upper end of Baird Court, was completed
in 1908. This drive is open to carriages or motors, daily,
and it affords easy access to the most important group of
buildings. It is subject to the same regulations as all other
entrances, except that carriages and automobiles are admitted.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The Boston Road, which runs through the Park from
south to north, near the western bank of the Bronx Lake, is
open at all hours. It has recently&mdash;and for the first time&mdash;been
finely improved by the Park Department for the Borough
of the Bronx, and a drive through it affords a fine
view of the eastern side of the Buffalo Range, and the finest
portion of the heavy forest of the Zoological Park.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, the ranges of the buffalo, antelope,
deer, moose, and elk, are in full view from the Kingsbridge
Road and Southern Boulevard, and the Zoological Society
has planned that the view from those avenues shall be left
open sufficiently that the herds may be seen to good advantage.</p>
<p><b>The Rocking Stone Restaurant, No. 46</b>, has been designed
to serve all the purposes that its name implies. It contains
dining-rooms in which full meals may be obtained, lunch-rooms
wherein choice food will be served at popular prices,
and in the basement, toilet-rooms will be found.</p>
<p><b>The Service Building, No. 28.</b>&mdash;Near the Reptile House,
and at the geographical center of the enclosed grounds, is
situated a building which contains the Bureau of Administration
of the Zoological Park. Here will be found the offices
of the Chief Clerk, several other Park officers, and the workshops
and storerooms.</p>
<p>Children lost in the Park, and property lost or found,
should be reported without delay at the Chief Clerk&rsquo;s office
in this building. The telephone call of the Zoological Park
is 953 Tremont.</p>
<p><b>Wheeled Chairs.</b>&mdash;By persons desiring them, wheeled
chairs can always be obtained at the entrances, by applying
to gatekeepers, or at the office of the Chief Clerk, in the
Service Building. The cost is 25 cents per hour; with an
attendant, 50 cents per hour.</p>
<p><b>Arrangement of Collections.</b>&mdash;Inasmuch as the physical
features of the Zoological Park grounds were important factors
in locating the various collections of animals, a perfect
zoological arrangement was impossible. The existing plan
represents the limit of acceptable possibilities in grouping
related animals.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The entire southern and western sides of the Park are
exclusively devoted to the Hoofed Animals, in addition to
which other members of that Order will be found at the
Elephant and Small-Mammal Houses. The Carnivorous
Animals will be found at the Lion House, Wolf and Fox
Dens, Small-Mammal House and Bear Dens. The Birds are
in two groups; one in the lower end of Bird Valley, and the
Large Bird-House on Baird Court; the other around the
Wild-Fowl Pond, south of the Wolf Dens.</p>
<p>The existence of six entrances to the Park renders it impossible
to lay out an all-embracing &ldquo;tour&rdquo; for the visitor,
and develop the Guide Book accordingly. The various collections
will be handled in zoological groups, but the various
groups cannot follow each other in zoological sequence. The
table of contents and a comprehensive index will render
each item of the subject matter quickly available.</p>
<h3 id="c6">PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE GROUNDS.</h3>
<p>The extreme length of the Park from north to south is
4,950 feet, or 330 feet less than one mile; and its extreme
width is 3,120 feet, or three-fifths of a mile. Roughly estimated,
one-third of the land area is covered by heavy
forest, one-third by open forest, and the remaining third consists
of open meadows and glades. The highest point of
land in the Park is the crest of Rocking Stone Hill, the
elevation of which is 94.8 feet above sea level.</p>
<p><b>Topography.</b>&mdash;Speaking broadly, the Zoological Park is
composed of granite ridges running from north to south.
In many places their crests have been denuded of earth by
the great glacier which once pushed its edge as far south as
New York City. In the valleys lying between these glacier-scraped
ridges, great quantities of sandy, micaceous soil
have been deposited; but in one spot&mdash;the Wild-Fowl Pond&mdash;what
was once a green, glacial lake fifteen feet deep, presently
became a vast rock-walled silo filled with vegetable
matter and a trembling bog of peat. Everywhere in the Park
glacial boulders of rough granite or smoothly rounded trap-rock,
varying in size from a cobble-stone to the thirty-ton
Rocking Stone, have been dropped just where the warm
southern sun freed them from the ice. The Park contains
thousands of them, many of which have been removed from
walks and building sites only with great labor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>In three of the four principal valleys of the Park, bogs
have been converted into ponds, and in the largest and deepest
of all lie Bronx Lake and Lake Agassiz. The bed-rock
underlying or cropping out in the Park exhibits pink granite,
gray granite, rotten gneiss, and quartz in bewildering
variety. Occasionally in trench-digging a ledge is encountered
which yields good building-stone for rough work, but
usually our rock is so full of mica as to be worthless.</p>
<p>The water-levels in the various portions of the Park are
as follows:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr class="th"><th> </th><th colspan="2">Above Sea Level.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Surface of Bronx Lake </td><td class="r">20.40 </td><td class="c">feet</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">Surface of Beaver Pond </td><td class="r">44.00 </td><td class="c">&ldquo;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The floor levels of some of the important buildings are as
follows:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr class="th"><th> </th><th colspan="2">Above Sea Level.</th></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Of the Antelope House </td><td class="r">88 </td><td class="c">feet</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Of the Reptile House </td><td class="r">78 </td><td class="c">&ldquo;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="l">Of the Aquatic-Bird House </td><td class="r">57 </td><td class="c">&ldquo;</td></tr>
</table>
<p><b>Soil.</b>&mdash;The soil varies from rich black muck in the valleys,
to light and very dry soil, full of mica and sand, on the
ridges and meadows. Where not packed hard, the latter is
very porous, and the heaviest rainfall is quickly absorbed,
or carried away on the surface. As a result, the valleys are
always moist and rich in grass, and the slopes and ridges
are always dry and warm.</p>
<p><b>Streams and Ponds.</b>&mdash;The Zoological Park contains about
34 acres of still water, of which Bronx Lake comprises 25
acres, Lake Agassiz 5&frac12; acres, Cope Lake, the Wild-Fowl
Pond, and Beaver Pond together, about 3&frac12; acres. The
two larger lakes are fed by the Bronx River, which drains
a valley about 15 miles long. Even in the driest seasons the
volume of water carried down by the Bronx River is sufficient
to keep the lakes well filled. The areas of still water
available for animal collections are very generous for an
institution like this, and are highly prized.</p>
<p><b>The Waterfall.</b>&mdash;At the lower end of Lake Agassiz, and
about 300 feet above the Boston Road Bridge, is a natural
waterfall nearly 12 feet in height, where the Bronx River
falls over a rugged ledge of pink granite. In times of high
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
water the foaming flood that thunders over the rocks makes
an imposing spectacle, and it constitutes a most unusual
feature to be found in a city park. During the year 1901,
an improvement was made which added very greatly to the
beauty of this feature by extending the rock ledge about
200 feet farther, to the rocky side of Wilson Hill, thereby
greatly increasing the water area of Lake Agassiz, and at the
same time forming a beautiful island.</p>
<p><b>Forests.</b>&mdash;The crowning glory of the Zoological Park is
the magnificent forest growth which covers, thickly or
sparsely, about two-thirds of its land area. It consists chiefly
of white, scarlet, black, red and pin oaks, tulip, sweet gum,
hickory, beech, sassafras, maple, wild cherry, hornbeam, dogwood,
tupelo, hemlock and cedar; but there are at least
thirty other species of trees and shrubs. Thanks to the
wise foresight and broad views of David and Philip Lydig,
who for about eighty years were the sole owners of nearly
the whole of the Zoological Park site, the virgin forest was
not cut down for firewood or lumber, but was carefully preserved
for posterity. As the legal custodian of this splendid
domain of Nature, the Zoological Society is as rapidly as
possible going over the entire forest, to arrest decay and
death, and take all needed measures for the preservation of
the trees. It is safe to say that nowhere else within fifty
miles of New York can there be found any more beautiful
forests than those in the central and eastern portions of the
Park. Throughout the enclosed grounds, it is absolutely
necessary that visitors should be restricted to the walks; for
otherwise the feet of our millions of visitors would quickly
destroy every ground plant.</p>
<p><b>The Rocking Stone, No. 45</b>, a colossal cube of pinkish
granite, poised on one of its angles on a smooth pedestal of
rock, is the Zoological Park&rsquo;s most interesting souvenir of
the glacial epoch. Across the bare face of the rocky hill
in which lies the Crocodile Pool, there are several glacial
scratches pointing directly toward the famous boulder; and
who will say it had no part in making one of them?</p>
<p>The Rocking Stone stands on a smooth table of granite on
the southern shoulder of the hill overlooking the Buffalo
Range. Its extreme height is 7 feet 6 inches; breadth, 10
feet 1 inch; thickness, 8 feet 1 inch, and its weight, as roughly
calculated, is 30 tons. A pressure of about 50 lbs. exerted on
the most northern angle of the stone causes its apex to swing
north and south about two inches.</p>

<h2>SECTION I.&mdash;THE MAMMALS.</h2>
<h4><span class="sc">The Hoofed Animals.</span></h4>
<p>The forming of a collection which shall fairly represent
the hoofed animals of the world is necessarily a work of
years. It is now (in 1915) fifteen years since the Zoological
Society entered upon this task, and during that period the
work of providing installations and living specimens has
been pursued with unflagging industry. In no feature of
our development has the Society been more liberal than in
the purchase of specimens for this collection, and the gifts
to it have been both numerous and valuable. In our 82
species and 330 specimens we feel that the Order <i>Ungulata</i>
is strongly represented. On April 1, 1913, the summary of
groups stood as follows:</p>

<p>The arrangement of this section of the Guide Book begins
at the Buffalo Entrance with the Bisons, and follows the
ranges, corrals and buildings for Hoofed Animals, along
the southern and western sides of the Park, to the Axis Deer
Range. The Elephant House is introduced as the visitor
leaves Baird Court, going south.</p>
<p>The large, open pastures are called &ldquo;ranges,&rdquo; and the
smaller fenced enclosures are known as &ldquo;corrals.&rdquo; The
fences are chiefly of hard steel wire, so strong and elastic
that the animals cannot break through them.</p>

<p><b>Warning.</b>&mdash;Visitors must <i>never</i> stand close beside a wire
fence or gate, because its elasticity between posts might
enable a charging animal to strike a person so standing and
inflict a serious injury, even though the fence or gate is not
in the least affected by the blow.</p>
<h3 id="c7">THE BISON RANGES, Nos. 51 and 52.</h3>
<p>Stretching from the Boston Road to the large Antelope
House (No. 50), and from the Rocking Stone to the southern
boundary, lies an open expanse of rolling meadow land, with
a total area of about twenty acres. It is almost surrounded
by shade-trees. Its easterly edge is a low-lying strip of rich
meadow, which lies under the shelter of the rocky, tree-covered
ridge that forms the natural retaining wall of the
higher plateau toward the west. This is the Bison Range.
It is the first enclosure seen on the left as the visitor enters
the Park from West Farms by way of the Boston Road.</p>
<p>On the north side of the main range, near the Rocking
Stone, are the four corrals, and the Bison House. The
latter is a rustic hillside barn, eighty feet in length, with a
semicircular front, affording shelter and feed storage for
thirty-four buffaloes. The flat roof of the Buffalo House is
open to the public from the main walk, and has been specially
designed as a convenient lookout over the main range
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
and corrals. There are other corrals, and a shelter shed,
at the Buffalo Entrance.</p>

<p class="pcap">EUROPEAN BISON: BULL.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The American Bison, or Buffalo</b>, (<i>B. americanus</i>), is the
largest and the best known of all North American hoofed
animals. What was once the universal herd, which occupied
the whole pasture region of the West, was cut in twain
in 1867, by the building of the first trans-continental railway.
The great &ldquo;southern herd,&rdquo; of several millions of
animals, was destroyed by skin hunters during the years
1871, 1872, 1873, and 1874, and the practical extinction of
the northern herd was accomplished between 1880 and
1884.</p>
<p>At present there are but two herds of wild bison in
existence. The largest band, now containing by estimate
about 300 individuals, inhabits a wide stretch of barren
and inhospitable territory southwest of Great Slave Lake.
About twenty head remain in the Yellowstone Park, more
than nine-tenths of the original herd having been slaughtered
by poachers since 1890. There are now about 2000
bison alive in captivity, chiefly in large private game preserves.</p>
<p>Usually bison calves are born in May, June, and July.
Full maturity is not reached until the end of the seventh
year, when the horns of the male&mdash;at first a straight spike&mdash;have
attained their full semi-circular curve. Like all thick-haired
animals of the temperate zone, the American bison
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
sheds its coat in spring, and does not regain full pelage
until October or November.</p>
<p>The bison breeds in confinement about as readily as
domestic cattle. In appearance, it is the most imposing of
all bovine animals, and with two exceptions it is also the
largest. In captivity its disposition is mild, though inclined
to stubbornness. Occasionally, however, an old bull becomes
so vicious that it is necessary to seclude him from
the herd, and treat him as a dangerous animal.</p>
<p>With the exception of a very few individuals, our entire
bison herd is the gift of the late William C. Whitney,
and the increase therefrom. The total number of head on
hand on April 1, 1913, was forty-two.</p>
<p>In 1906, the New York Zoological Society presented to the
United States Government a herd of fifteen bison to
serve as a nucleus for an independent National herd. The
Government very promptly fenced an area of twelve square
miles of fine grazing grounds in the Wichita Forest and
Game Reserve, for the proper reception of the herd. The
plan was consummated during 1907. The effort has proven
completely successful, and on April 1, 1913, the herd contained
thirty-seven bison, all in fine condition.</p>
<p><b>European Bison.</b>&mdash;In a corral adjoining the Buffalo Entrance,
on the Boston Road, are to be found two specimens
of the rare and almost extinct European Bison, (<i>Bos bonasus</i>).
This species is the nearest living relative of the
American bison, and the two specimens (male and female),
now exhibited, came quite unexpectedly into the possession
of the Zoological Society in April, 1904. They were acquired
from the small captive herd in the forest of the
Prince of Pless, in Silesia, south-eastern Germany, and are
the first living specimens of the species to be exhibited in
America. They were presented to the Society by Mr. Norman
James, of Baltimore, Mr. Charles Sheldon and Dr.
Leonard J. Sanford.</p>
<p>The distinguishing characters of this species are shorter
and less abundant hair on the head, neck and shoulders
than our bison, a tail densely covered with hair throughout
its length, very long legs, and a short body.</p>
<p>But for royal protection, this species would long ere this
have become extinct. In the year 1857, about 1,898 head
were living, but in 1892 the total had decreased to 491. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
appears, however, that an increase can safely be announced.
An estimate recently published (1906) places the total
number of wild and semi-wild individuals at 1,400, while
in the captive herds of the Czar and the Prince of Pless
there are 46 more. About 700 of the survivors inhabit the
forests of Bielowitza and Swisslotsch, Lithuania, west Russia,
and are strictly protected by the Czar. Other bands
still exist on the northern slope of the Caucasus Mountains
around the sources of the Laba and Bjellaja, sometimes
ranging up to an elevation of 8,000 feet. Wherever found,
they live in scattered bands of from three to ten individuals.
All the survivors of this species are so jealously
guarded that very few of the zoological gardens of Europe
have been able to procure specimens.</p>
<p>This animal is very often miscalled the &ldquo;aurochs,&rdquo; and
from this error much confusion has arisen. The true aurochs,
(<i>Bos primigenius</i>), was the wild progenitor of some
of the existing breeds of domestic cattle, but it is now
extinct.</p>
<h3 id="c8">MOUNTAIN SHEEP HILL, No. 44.</h3>
<p>The wild sheep and goats of the world form an exceedingly
interesting group of animals. In form they are odd
and picturesque, and in temper and mentality they are
everything that could be desired. All the year round, deer
are either nervous or dangerous, and difficult to handle.
Wild sheep, goats and ibex appreciate man&rsquo;s interest in
them, and even when not fond of attention, they act sensibly
when it is necessary to handle them.</p>
<p>The Zoological Park collection of wild sheep and goats is
one of the most interesting features of the Park. Mountain
Sheep Hill is the first high ridge west of the Rocking Stone,
and its northern end is very near the Bear Dens and Reptile
House. It consists of a ridge of pink granite 500 feet long
and 25 feet high, its southern end fully exposed, but the
northern end well shaded by oaks and cedars. For grazing
animals that love to climb, and pose on the sky line, the
slopes of bare rock, set in patches of hard, green turf, are
almost ideal. In the eastern face of the ridge, rock excavations
have been made, and five roomy caves have been constructed
in such a manner that they are cool in summer,
warm in winter, and dry at all times. On April 1, 1913,
the six wire enclosures on Mountain Sheep Hill contained
the following species:</p>

<p>Because of the curious (and unaccountable) fact that they
do not thrive on Mountain Sheep Hill, the Rocky Mountain
Goat and Chamois are exhibited elsewhere. The former will
be found near the Pheasant Aviary, next to the Musk-ox.</p>
<p>Visitors are requested to make note of the fact that <i>in
winter</i>, the <i>Arcal Sheep, Mouflon, and other delicate sheep
are exhibited in the Small-Deer House</i>.</p>
<p><b>The White-Fronted Musk-Ox</b>, (<i>Ovibos wardi</i>, Lydekker),
is represented in the Park by a herd of six specimens. Five
of these animals were born in May, 1910, in Ellesmere Land,
and captured in that year by Paul J. Rainey and Harry C.
Whitney, and presented by Mr. Rainey. The sixth individual,
a vigorous and rather vicious female, was born on Melville
Island, in May, 1909, and captured by Captain Joseph
Bernier. Owing to the domineering temper of &ldquo;Miss Melville,&rdquo;
it is not possible to keep her with the animals a year
younger than herself, because she resents their presence in
her corral.</p>
<p>The Musk-Ox is an animal of strange form, inhabiting
a small portion of the Arctic regions of the western hemisphere,
up to the very northernmost points of land east of the
Mackenzie River. At Fort Conger (Latitude 81&deg;, 40&prime;),
its flesh was a godsend to General Greely, and later on to
Commander Peary, also. Structurally, this animal stands
in a genus of its own (<i>Ovibos</i>), midway between the cattle
and the sheep, but it is unqualifiedly a misnomer to call it
a &ldquo;musk-sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An adult male Musk-Ox stands 4 ft. 5 in. high at the
shoulders and is 6 ft. 7 in. in total length. Our first specimen
was a female, two years old. She stood 3 ft. 2 in. high at
the shoulders, and was 4 ft. 10 in. in total length. Her
entire body was covered by a dense mass of fine light brown
hair, of a woolly nature, overlaid by a thatch of very long,
straight hair specially designed to shed rain.</p>
<p>The Musk-Ox inhabits the Barren Grounds of northern
Canada north of Latitude 64&deg; from Great Bear Lake to
Hudson Bay, Grant Land, and the northeast coast of Greenland
from Franz Josef Fiord (Latitude 70&deg;) to the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
northerly point of land. About twenty living specimens
have been taken when very young at Franz Josef Fiord,
by Swedish and Norwegian whaling parties. The Peary
Arctic Club, of New York, presented to the New York
Zoological Society a young calf which was captured by
Commander Peary at Fort Conger, in 1902, but it lived
only a few months.</p>

<p><b>The Big-Horn Mountain Sheep</b>, (<i>Ovis canadensis</i>), is
exhibited in the Zoological Park, whenever it may be obtained.
The efforts that have been made in New York,
Philadelphia, Washington and Chicago to acclimatize the
Big-Horn of the Rocky Mountains have proven the extreme
difficulty involved in keeping specimens of that
species alive and in good condition anywhere in the Mississippi
Valley, or on the Atlantic coast. The changes of atmosphere
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
and temperature seem more violent than American
mountain sheep are fitted by nature to endure, and
thus far all specimens tried have died within a comparatively
few months.</p>

<p>In his own country, the Rocky Mountain Big-Horn is a
bold, hardy and robust animal. He is high-headed, keen-sighted,
and a sure-footed mountaineer. He dwells in the
wildest and most picturesque country that he can find between
the &ldquo;bad-lands&rdquo; of western North Dakota and the
line of perpetual snow on the Rockies. His massive circling
horns render his head a much-coveted trophy, and his
flesh is most excellent food. A full-grown ram (<i>Ovis canadensis</i>)
stands 41 inches in height at the shoulders, and
weighs 316 pounds.</p>

</div>
<p>This species ranges from the northern states of Mexico
to northern British Columbia and it culminates (i. e.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
reaches its finest development) in southeastern British Columbia.
In Northwest Alaska other related species occur.
A female specimen from southeastern British Columbia was
exhibited in the Zoological Park during 1905 and 1906, and
in 1902, a male specimen of a closely related species (<i>Ovis
nelsoni</i>) was also here.</p>
<p>As opportunities offer to procure male specimens, that
have been kept in their home region until they are at least
a year and a half old, they will be purchased and exhibited.</p>
<p><b>The Mouflon</b>, (<i>Ovis musimon</i>), or <b>Wild Sheep</b> of Sardinia,
is represented by a fine pair of specimens presented
by Maurice Egerton, Esq., of London, and a young male
born in the Park. The female of the adult pair was captured
when a lamb in the mountains of Sardinia by Mr.
Egerton. The ram of this species is handsomely colored,
and this specimen is noted for his friendliness, and his fondness
for admiration.</p>
<p><b>The Arcal Mountain Sheep</b>, (<i>Ovis cycloceros</i>), is one of
the smallest mountain sheep of India of the &ldquo;big-horn&rdquo;
type (with circling horns). The fully adult male, with its
long undermane of coarse, shaggy hair and proud postures,
is a very noteworthy creature. This species inhabits the
mountains of northern India, Tibet, Afghanistan, Beluchistan
and southern Persia.</p>
<p><b>The Burrhel</b>, or <b>Blue Mountain Sheep</b>, (<i>Ovis burrhel</i>),
also of northern India, is of quite a different mould from
the preceding species. Its countenance has almost a benign
expression, and its curious out-pointing horns, of large size
give it a most jaunty air. By some it is regarded as the
most beautiful of all mountain sheep. In size, however, it
is not imposing, for it is one of the smallest species. It is
not so hardy as the preceding species, and there may be
periods when there are no specimens on exhibition.</p>
<p><b>The Aoudad</b>, or <b>Barbary Wild Sheep</b>, (<i>Ovis tragelaphus</i>),
comes from the hot, dry mountains of northern Africa, and
it endures the cold, wet climate of New York in a manner
sufficient to put to shame our American mountain sheep,
goat and other western ruminants. The largest male Aoudad
of our herd is a very fine specimen of its kind. He is
as fond of admiration as any peacock, and often poses in
striking attitudes on the highest point of his rocks. He
was born here on March 19, 1902.</p>
<p><b>The Himalayan Tahr</b>, (<i>Hemitragus jemlaicus</i>), is really
a wild goat, of very odd and picturesque aspect, native of
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
the higher ranges of the Himalayas of northern India. Its
horns are short and thick, and its body is covered with
long, purplish-brown hair which is much blown about by
the wind. It dwells amongst the most dangerous crags and
precipices, just below timber-line, and in reality is a forest-loving
animal. Its hair is the longest to be found on any
member of the two subfamilies of goats and goat-like animals.
The pair on exhibition have bred here, and the
young have been successfully reared to maturity. The
young Tahr is very small, but remarkably nimble-footed
and capable.</p>
<p><b>The Chamois</b>, (<i>Rupicapra tragus</i>), has usually been represented
in the hoofed-animal collection, but always out of its
proper installation. Our individuals have not thriven on
Mountain Sheep Hill, always becoming ill soon after being
placed there. They thrive well, however, in a small wire
pen with a sanded floor quite near the Puma and Lynx House
(No. 33A), and there we keep them.</p>
<p>This animal is one of the rock antelopes, and is related
to the American Mountain Goat. It is a bold mountaineer,
and even to-day is pictorially represented as leaping
&ldquo;from crag to crag&rdquo; across chasms apparently 200 feet
wide! Its home is in the mountains of southern Europe,
especially the Pyrenees, the Swiss Alps and the Caucasus
Mountains. But it is not so exclusively a crag-dweller, as
most persons have been led to suppose, for in many localities
it inhabits mountain forests. Like most other mountain
ungulates, the Chamois dwell high in summer, and in
winter they seek lower and more sheltered situations. They
are exceedingly wary and agile, and sure-footed on dangerous
ground.</p>
<h3 id="c9">THE ANTELOPE HOUSE, NO. 50.</h3>
<p>The Antelope House occupies a commanding situation on
a high, tree-covered knoll at the south end of the Zoological
Park. The situation seems as if specially formed by Nature
to be occupied by this building, and its outside enclosures.
The drainage is quite perfect, and the yards are
well-shaded.</p>
<p>The building has been designed to meet the wants of
giraffes and large African antelopes of all kinds, more
especially those which require 60&deg; of heat in winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/pmg020.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="403" />
<p class="pcap">NILGAI: INDIAN ANTELOPE.</p>
</div>
<p>The Antelope House is 142 feet long by 78 feet in extreme
width. In architectural style it conforms with the
other large animal buildings of the Park. Both for visitors
and for its animals, it is roomy and well lighted, and in
every way fitted to house and display a large and valuable
collection of tropical hoofed animals. It contains 24 interior
compartments, directly connected with 23 open-air
yards for use in mild weather. This building was completed
and occupied on October 17, 1903, and with all its
surrounding improvements has cost about $80,000.</p>
<p>As the visitor will observe from the following enumeration
of species, our collection of large and rare African and
Asiatic antelopes is very rich. Unfortunately, until the
completion of the Zebra House releases the apartments now
occupied by the equines, a number of species which belong
in the Antelope House must temporarily be quartered elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>The Nubian</b> or <b>Three-Horned Giraffes</b>, (<i>Giraffa camelopardalis</i>),
are at present the most important and interesting
animals in the building. The pair came from German East
Africa, are now (April, 1913) about twelve years old, and
cost $5,500. The male stands 14 feet 4 inches in height,
and the female 12 feet 6 inches. Both are good-tempered
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
animals, and have been in good health ever since their
arrival. Their food consists of clover hay, broken forage-biscuits,
an assortment of raw vegetables carefully cut into
small pieces, a small quantity of bran, and rock salt.</p>
<p>A study of the Giraffes reveals most interesting conditions.
According to the point of view, the total number
of species and subspecies may be reckoned at any number
from three to six, inclusive. According to the specimens in
hand, the Southern, or Two-Horned Giraffe, (<i>Giraffa capensis</i>),
seems clearly defined from the Northern, or Three-Horned
Giraffe, (<i>G. camelopardalis</i>). Next, the Somali Giraffe,
(<i>G. reticulata</i>), of the Lake Rudolph region and northern
British East Africa, seems fairly separable. At first
the Five-Horned Giraffe, of western Uganda, seemed quite
distinct, but now British naturalists hesitate about according
to it rank as a separate species, because of its intergradation
with the Nubian form, (<i>camelopardalis</i>).</p>
<p>Judging from all evidence now available, it seems that
the Giraffes of to-day represent the midway stage of an
effort to develop several species from the parent stock,
the Three-Horned Giraffe, which is the species here represented.
The existing forms, including all species and subspecies,
intergrade and run together in a manner that is
fairly bewildering; but if the Giraffes could remain uninfluenced
by man for a sufficiently long period the probabilities
are that the species now branching off would be
clearly established.</p>
<p>The oldest, the best-known and the most common Giraffe
is the three-horned species, found from central Uganda
southward. The five-horned variety meets the former in
Uganda, and occurs from that region westward to the edge
of the great equatorial forest, and on westward even to
Lake Tchad, and the lower Niger Valley. Excepting in
Uganda, Kahma&rsquo;s country, and a few other protected districts,
the Giraffe is now rare, particularly throughout the
regions that are accessible to hunters. Thousands of these
wonderful creatures have been killed by hunters, both
white and black, solely for the sake of seeing them dead,
and leaving them as prey to the hy&aelig;nas and hunting-dogs.
It seems to be beyond the power of most men who can
shoot to see living wild animals, no matter how large or
wonderful, without desiring to reduce them to carcasses,
fit only for scavengers.</p>

<p><b>The Eland</b>, (<i>Taurotragus oryx</i>), is the largest and most
imposing of all antelopes. As might be inferred from its
great size, it is now so nearly extinct that it has almost disappeared
from the lists of dealers in wild animals. The
fine young pair now in the Antelope House was presented by
the Duke of Bedford, from his famous animal collection at
Woburn Park. The fully adult female is the gift of Mr. C.
Ledyard Blair.</p>
<p>Of Elands there are two well-marked species. That of
eastern and southern Africa, here represented, was once
numerous on many of the fertile plains of the great plateau
now known as Rhodesia, and in fact throughout nearly the
whole of the uplands of eastern Africa, from the Cape to
the Sahara. Unfortunately, however, white hunters and
modern firearms have reduced the countless thousands of
the great herds to numbers so small that the capture and
exportation of Elands have practically ceased.</p>
<p>Although a number of Elands have been born in captivity,
the number on public exhibition still remain very
small. The only captive herd known to the writer is that
of the Duke of Bedford, in Woburn Park, England, which
is at once the admiration and envy of all collectors of living
wild animals.</p>
<p><b>The White-Tailed Gnu</b>, (<i>Connochaetes gnu</i>), once was
abundant in South Africa, south of the Vaal River. But it
has shared the fate of all the other large mammals of that
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
region, and only a few scattered bands still exist. Nearly
all of the specimens now living in captivity were born in
captivity, for both species of Gnu take kindly to life in
parks and gardens.</p>
<p>Every way considered, the Gnu is an animal of odd and
remarkable form. It has a nose of strange shape, its
horns are curiously formed, the hair on its head and neck
exhibits various peculiarities, and its hips are oddly modeled.
Its long, flowing tail is so horse-like that for many
years this animal was pictured and popularly known as the
&ldquo;Horned Horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The White-Bearded Gnu</b>, (<i>Connochaetes albojubatus</i>), is
noticeably larger than the white-tailed species, and in some
respects it presents a finer appearance. Its bulk is considerably
greater, and its color is more pleasing. This species
bears a strong resemblance to the third species, which
is known as the <b>Brindled</b> or <b>Blue Gnu</b>, (<i>Connochaetes taurinus</i>),
from which the former is distinguished by its white
mane and jaw-tufts, and generally paler color. At wide
intervals the White-Bearded species inhabits southern East
Africa, from about S. Lat. 23&deg;, to the Albert Nyanza and
Lake Rudolph, but chiefly near the coast. In only one
locality do we learn of its occurrence west of the 30th meridian.
To-day it is most numerous in German East Africa
and the southern portions of Uganda.</p>
<p><b>The Addax Antelope</b>, (<i>Addax naso-maculatus</i>), is a spiral-horned
antelope which inhabits the southern edge of the
Sahara Desert from Dongola quite across Africa to Senegal.
Its extremely broad and spreading hoofs betoken a dweller
upon sand, and are strongly suggestive of the snow-shoe
hoofs of the caribou. It is said that this animal is not to
be taken without making a journey into the desert, with
camels.</p>
<p><b>The Leucoryx Antelope</b>, (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>), is the only
member of its genus which has curved horns. Because of the
length and very slight curvature of the horns, this species
has by some writers been spoken of as the <b>Sabre Antelope</b>,
and by a mischievous perversion that name has been turned
into &ldquo;Sable&rdquo; Antelope, which refers to a totally different
creature, (<i>Hippotragus niger</i>). Anyone who places an order
for the purchase of a real Sable Antelope, and receives a
Leucoryx instead of <i>Hippotragus niger</i>, is profoundly disappointed.</p>
<p>This species is a desert habitant, and its home is the desert
region of North Africa from Dongola to the Senegal country.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
It is breeding regularly here, and the offspring mature
successfully. The largest Leucoryx horns on record measure
39&#8541; inches.</p>

<p><b>The Beisa Antelope</b>, (<i>Oryx beisa</i>), is a good representative
of the group of straight-horned antelopes found in the genus
<i>Oryx</i>. Of all the long-horned species, the two Beisas and
the Gemsbok of Africa, and the Beatrix of Arabia, are the
only species possessed of horns that are practically straight
from base to tip. The Gemsbok is the largest and most
showy species, being painted like a harlequin, in a startling
pattern of roan, black and white. The Beisa is a good
second, however. The horns of all these antelopes grow
to great length, and are excellent weapons for use in
encounters with the smaller game-killing carnivores. The
largest horns of record measure 40 inches.</p>
<p>The Beisa inhabits eastern Central Africa, from Suakin
on the Red Sea southward to the Equator.</p>
<p><b>The Beatrix Antelope</b>, (<i>Oryx beatrix</i>), of the Arabian
Desert, is one of the rarest antelopes to be found in captivity,
and at this date this interesting species is represented
by a fine pair of specimens. The longest horns of record
measure 26 inches. Very few sportsmen have seen this
animal in its native haunts. Our pair has been breeding
for three years, and has reared two young.</p>
<p><b>The Sable Antelope</b>, (<i>Hippotragus niger</i>), is by many
persons regarded as the handsomest of all the numerous
species of African antelopes. In appearance it is very proud
and high-headed; it has imposing horns that sweep backward
in a semicircular curve; its large eyes and alert air betoken
keen intelligence, and its glossy black coat, marked with pure
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
white, render it a most conspicuous animal. On its native
veldt it has now become a very rare species, and seldom is
taken by sportsmen. The fine male specimen in the Park was
presented by Miss Jean Walker Simpson.</p>

<p><b>The Sing-Sing Waterbuck</b>, (<i>Cobus unctuosus</i>), is a creature
of the lowlands, and frequents the dense tangles of tall
reeds that border many of the rivers of West Africa, above
the great equatorial forest. In captivity it sometimes is
one of the most insanely nervous and irrational creatures
imaginable, ever seeking self-inflicted injuries.</p>
<p><b>The Blessbok</b>, (<i>Damaliscus albifrons</i>), is a small but handsome
purple-and-white antelope which is now very nearly
extinct. Formerly a number of herds were preserved on
fenced farms in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, but
it is feared that none of them survived the Boer War. This
species never lived north of the Limpopo, but south of that
river it once was so numerous that a truthful traveler
described a vast plain as being &ldquo;purple with Blessbok.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Nilgai</b>, (<i>Portax tragocamelus</i>), is the largest of the
Indian antelopes, and while it has the stature and the high
shoulders of a Baker roan antelope, its absurdly small
horns give it, beside the large antelopes of Africa, a very
commonplace and unfinished appearance. The males and
females are as differently colored as if they belonged to
different species. This animal inhabits the roughest
portions of the central plains of Hindustan, from Mysore to
the Himalayas. In northern India it is found along the
rivers Jumna and Ganges, in rugged and barren tracts of
ravines which in character and origin resemble our western
&ldquo;bad-lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The small antelopes will be found in the Small-Deer
House, the next building in order.</p>
<h3 id="c10">THE SMALL-DEER HOUSE, No. 49.</h3>
<p>In captivity the small and delicate species of deer, antelopes
and gazelles are better cared for in enclosures that
are not too large. For such creatures, freedom in a large
enclosure usually means early death from accident or exposure.</p>
<p>The very important building called the Small-Deer House
has been erected with special reference to the wants of the
interesting little hoofed animals which are too small for the
Antelope House and the large ranges. In winter it will
shelter the small tropical mountain sheep and goats, which
are unable to withstand the rigors of outdoor life on Mountain
Sheep Hill, and the tropical swine may also be expected
here.</p>
<p>The Small-Deer House is situated in close proximity to
the Antelope House, and westward thereof. Of the buildings
of secondary rank, it is one of the most satisfactory,
being roomy, well-lighted and capable of comfortably housing
and displaying a large and varied collection. The structure
is 158 feet in length by 46 feet in width. It contains
thirty compartments, each of which, under stress of necessity,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
can be partitioned, and formed into two. The interior
compartments are each 10 feet wide by 10 feet deep.
The building is surrounded by a series of 34 corrals, connecting
with the interior compartments, the average size of
each being 75 feet long by 20 feet wide at the outer end.
All the fences are of wire, and were specially designed in
the Park for this installation.</p>

<p>It is a practical impossibility to offer an enumeration of
the living animals in this building which will permanently
apply, and the best that can be attempted is an approximation.
It is an inexorable law of Nature that the smallest
animals shall have the shortest periods of life, and in a
zoological park a small hoofed animal may be here to-day
and gone to-morrow. In the following enumeration, mention
will be made only of those species which are likely to
remain longest on exhibition; and it may be observed that
in this building there will be found various animals which
are neither deer nor antelopes.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">The Small Deer.</span></h4>
<p><b>Osceola White-Tailed Deer</b>, (<i>Odocoileus virginianus osceola</i>),
is an interesting geographic race of the northern
White-Tailed Deer which forms the parent stem of a group
of six or seven subspecies. The robust and hardy northern
type, often with large and strong antlers, gradually diminishes
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
in size and in antlers, until in Mexico it becomes a
small and delicate creature, with very small and light antlers
bearing only two or three small tines. The next form has so
widely diverged from the original type that it is necessary
to accord it rank as a full species.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/pmg028.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" />
<p class="pcap">REDUNCA ANTELOPE.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Sinaloa White-Tailed Deer</b>, (<i>Odocoileus sinaloae</i>), is
still smaller and weaker than the preceding. Our pair of
specimens shown was obtained by Mr. and Mrs. C. William
Beebe, in the State of Guadalajara, Mexico, and are highly
interesting as a link near the lower terminus of the <i>Odocoileus</i>
chain. On a majority of the antlers of this species
there are no branches whatever, but simply a weak main
beam, curving over at the tip, and terminating in a rounded
point.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the White-Tailed Deer group,
(<i>Odocoileus</i>), is very well represented in South America by
<i>O. weigmanni</i> of the Guianas.</p>
<p><b>The Marsh Deer</b>, (<i>Blastoceros paludosus</i>), of eastern
South America, is the largest South American deer. Our
first specimen was obtained in 1904. Its antlers are strongly
built but short, and in architecture resemble the antlers
of a Siamese species known as Schomburgk Deer, (<i>Cervus
schomburgki</i>); but the latter has on each beam three double
bifurcations, while the former has but two. The Marsh
Deer has very large, wide-spreading hoofs, which it would
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
seem have been developed by many generations of existence
on soft ground. It inhabits the jungles along river banks,
in Brazil. The head of this animal is of remarkable length.</p>
<p>This important species is rather weak in captivity, and it
is by no means certain that it can constantly be exhibited
here. There is another South American species, (<i>Blastoceros
campestris</i>), which is a zoological understudy, or miniature,
of the large Marsh Deer.</p>
<p><b>The Black-Faced Brocket</b>, (<i>Mazama tema</i>), <i>whenever it
can be obtained</i>, will represent a group of American deer
which is as little known in the United States as if it inhabited
the heart of Borneo. The Brockets are smaller
than the Sinaloa white-tailed deer, and they are so nearly
hornless that the antler is merely a small, straight, sharp-pointed
spike of bone only three inches long. The adult
animal is only 25 inches in shoulder height, which is about
the size of the muntjac of India. Of the Brockets there are
several species, mostly South American, but from skulls and
horns received we now know that it is found as far north
as the State of Puebla, Mexico. A correspondent in that
locality is constantly endeavoring to secure specimens for
us, and no doubt will shortly succeed. For the reason that
we expect specimens in the near future, this species is included.</p>
<p><b>The Hog Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus porcinus</i>), which is very unlike a
hog, and is libeled by its name, is a small species from India,
which is provided with long and well-shaped antlers having
a total of six points. Sometimes the adult males are spotted
in summer, and sometimes they are not. This species
stands next to the beautiful axis deer. It breeds well in
captivity, but is a very nervous and even hysterical animal.</p>
<p><b>The Molucca Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus moluccensis</i>), is a thick-bodied,
scantily-clad and coarse-haired understudy of the
Malay sambar, (<i>Cervus unicolor</i>). Of all deer it is one of
the least beautiful. Its hair resembles the bristles of a wild
hog, and its color is a dull, raw-umber brown. It belongs
to the sambar group of East Indian deer, and really marks,
both geographically and in size, the farthest departure
from the type species of the group.</p>
<p><b>The Muntjac or Rib-Faced Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus muntjac</i>), is one
of the most interesting of all species of small deer. In one
respect it is unique. Its tiny antlers, which are only 4&frac12;
inches in length, are placed high up on stems of solid bone,
which sometimes rise 3&frac34; inches clear of the cranium.
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
These pedicles of bone are covered with skin, quite up to
the burr of the antler. The front angles of these pedicles are
continued down the face to the nasal bones, and form the
two sharply defined facial ridges which have given this
creature one of its popular names.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/pmg029.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="394" />
<p class="pcap">SASIN ANTELOPE.</p>
</div>
<p>In India the Muntjac inhabits the jungles of the tiger,
the leopard, axis deer and sloth bear, and escapes from its
numerous enemies by hiding behind logs, and scurrying
through the thick underbush so swiftly that its pursuers can
not keep it in view. Its flesh is most excellent food. From
its peculiar, yapping cry, many times repeated, it is often
called the Barking Deer. It breeds readily in captivity, and
its bright fawn color attracts to it much attention.</p>
<p><b>The Musk Deer</b>, (<i>Moschus moschiferus</i>), of northern India,
Tibet and Southern China is the creature which produces
the well-known musk perfume of commerce. The
product is secreted by the male in the &ldquo;rutting&rdquo; season.
This species is one of the smallest of the true deer. Its
most remarkable anatomical feature is a pair of very long
and sharp canine teeth in the upper jaw, the points of which
project far below the lower jaw. No horns are present in
this animal. Being short-lived in captivity, and also difficult
to obtain, it must be classed as an intermittent exhibit.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">The Small African Antelopes.</span></h4>
<p>In addition to the grand array of large antelopes inhabiting
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
Africa, of which many fine examples will be found in
the Antelope House, there is an extensive series of small
species. Indeed, the richness of Africa in antelopes, great
and small, is almost beyond belief. The species of Asia and
Europe are so few, and so inconspicuous, that they seem like
so many stray wanderers from the Dark Continent. The
fertile, grassy plains of the great Central African plateau
have cradled scores of species, some of which have wandered
into the deserts, the forests and the fluviatile swamps, and
there made their permanent homes.</p>
<p><b>The Black-Buck</b>, or <b>Sasin Antelope</b>, (<i>Antilope cervicapra</i>),
of the central plains of Hindustan, is one of the handsomest
of the smaller antelopes. The horns of the male are long,
strongly ringed, twisted spirally, and rise from the head in
the shape of a V, sometimes to a length of 28 inches. At
first the young males are fawn-colored, like the females, but
as they grow older they steadily grow darker, until finally
the whole upper body and lower neck are suffused with a
rich, brown-black color. On the plains between the rivers
Ganges and Jumna, herds of Black-Buck live in densely populated
agricultural regions, and one of the greatest difficulties
attendant upon its pursuit lies in shooting an animal
without also shooting the native.</p>
<p><b>The Reedbuck</b>, (<i>Cervicapra arundinum</i>), of South Africa,
below Angola and Mozambique, is closely related to the
larger and much more showy waterbucks, but is distinguished
from them by the pronounced forward curve of its
horns. In the western districts of Cape Colony, the number
alive, in 1905, was estimated at 350 individuals.</p>
<p><b>The Common Duiker Antelope</b>, (<i>Cephalophus grimmi</i>), or
for that matter, any species of Duiker&mdash;may be regarded
as the representative of a large group of very small African
antelopes, of wide distribution. There are about twenty
species in all, and the great majority of them are very
modestly colored, in coats of one or two colors only. The
prevailing tints are grayish brown and tawny red. The
horns of the various species of Duikers are all very much
alike. With but one or two exceptions, their horns are
straight spikes from 3 to 5 inches in length. In shoulder
height the Duikers vary from 14 to 30 inches, but the majority
are between 17 and 22 inches. Only three or four species
are strikingly colored.</p>
<p><b>The Four-Horned Antelope</b>, (<i>Tetraceros quadricornis</i>) is
a small creature which looks like a duiker, but is very far
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
from belonging to that genus. It is an inhabitant of the
brushy plains of India, and enjoys the unique distinction of
possessing two pairs of horns. In addition to the 4-inch
pair, normally placed, it has a much smaller pair, usually
only 1 inch in height, which rises from the central area of
the forehead. I believe it is the only species of antelope
which possesses two pairs of horns.</p>

<p class="pcap">GREAT GRAY KANGAROO.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Springbuck</b>, (<i>Antidorcas euchore</i>), is to South Africa
as the &ldquo;prong-horn&rdquo; is to our great western plains. Once,
both were abundant, and the first hoofed animal to greet the
traveler who entered their respective domains. To-day,
both species are so nearly extinct that the hunter must
search long before finding even one. The Springbuck received
its name in recognition of its remarkable habit of
leaping high into the air when running&mdash;a habit which also
is displayed by the black-buck of India.</p>
<p><b>The Gazelles</b> are found only in Asia and Africa, and the
number of species is about 25. In general terms they may
be described as dainty antelopes,&mdash;so slender and delicate in
leg construction that it seems strange that such slender
bones can support a tall animal without breaking.</p>
<p><b>The Dorcas Gazelle</b>, of Arabia, (<i>Gazella dorcas</i>), is the
species which most frequently finds its way into captivity,
and it will serve very well as a specimen species for the
whole group. Despite its delicate and frail appearance, it
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
is much more enduring in captivity than many animals
which seem far more robust. A pair which entered the Park
in 1900 is still living. The male has a temper which quite
belies the reputation of the &ldquo;gentle gazelle.&rdquo; Although
loyal and kind to his cage-mate, toward human beings generally
he has manifested a very savage disposition, and in
one of his fits of bad temper he broke off one of his own
horns.</p>

<p class="pcap">ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Indian Gazelle</b>, (<i>Gazella benneti</i>),&mdash;frequently called
in its home country Ravine &ldquo;Deer,&rdquo;&mdash;is a habitant of the
sterile, water-washed ravines of northern and central India,
which are the oriental counterpart of our western &ldquo;badlands.&rdquo;
This animal inhabits the same regions as the black-buck,
but because of the religious scruples of the Hindoos
against the taking of life, both species are secure from attack&mdash;until
the arrival among them of the white sahibs. A
full-grown Indian Gazelle is 26 inches in shoulder height.
The females of this species possess horns, which are very
slender, and vary in length from 4 to 8&frac12; inches.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><span class="sc">Miscellaneous Mammals.</span></h3>
<p>The Small-Deer House will at all times contain various
mammals which are there shown because it is a practical
impossibility to provide a separate building for each group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p><b>The Wild Swine</b> of the world are here represented by three
noteworthy species:</p>
<p><b>The Red River-Hog</b>, (<i>Potamochaerus pencillatus</i>), of West
Africa, is about the only handsome species of swine that
Nature has produced. In form it is compact and well-turned,
its long pencil-tipped ears are of pleasing pattern, and its
hair is a rich auburn color, and the temper of our specimen
is everything that could be desired. Beside it is shown
&ldquo;Clarence,&rdquo; the <b>East African Wart-Hog</b>, (<i>Phacochaerus
aethiopicus</i>), who is equally interesting, but in a different
way. This species is very weird in form. <b>The Collared
Peccary</b>, (<i>Tagassu angulatum</i>), beside it is more like the wild
swine of Europe and Japan, and is not nearly so dangerous
as general reputation demands.</p>
<p><b>The Kangaroos.</b>&mdash;Seldom is there found in Nature a group
of large-animal species whose members are so monotonously
similar in general appearance as are the Kangaroos and
Wallabies, of Australia. The great majority are either gray
or gray-brown, and the only striking variation is found in
the big <b>Red Kangaroo</b>, (<i>Macropus rufus</i>).</p>
<h3 id="c12">THE WHITE MOUNTAIN GOAT, No. 48.</h3>
<p>Fortunate indeed is the zoological park or garden which
can exhibit even one living specimen of the White Mountain
Goat. It is a very difficult matter to take an animal
from a rarified dry atmosphere, at an elevation of 8,000
feet, and induce it to live at sea level, in a dense and humid
atmosphere, on food to which it is by nature wholly unaccustomed.</p>
<p>We have been successful in establishing here, on a breeding
basis this rare and difficult animal, (<i>Oreamnos montanus</i>).
One kid was born in 1908 and another in 1910, and
both have thriven, the former now being so large as to look
like an adult specimen.</p>
<p>For some subtle reason which we can not explain, these
animals&mdash;like the chamois and mouflon quartered in small
pens near the Small-Mammal House&mdash;do not thrive in any
of the large, rock-bound corrals of Mountain Sheep Hill.
They are kept in a rock-paved corral near the Pheasant
Aviary and the Crotona Entrance, and to their use has been
devoted a rustic barn, which they shelter in or climb over,
according to the weather. To see them walking nonchalantly
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
over the steep roof, or perching upon its peak, is one of
the drollest sights of the Park.</p>
<p>The White Goat, sometimes mistakenly called &ldquo;goat antelope,&rdquo;
belongs to a small group known as the Rupicaprines
or rock antelopes. It inhabits many different kinds of territory,
but usually the rugged sides and summits of high
mountains, at irregular intervals from southwestern Montana
and northern Washington, northward to the head of
Cook Inlet on the coast of Alaska. (See map of distribution,
with label.) The valley of the upper Yukon contains practically
no goats. They are most abundant in southeastern
British Columbia, where in a very small area, in September,
1905, Mr. John M. Phillips and the writer actually counted
239 individuals.</p>
<p>Of the five animals now exhibited in the Park, three were
captured a few days after their birth, in May, 1905, about
seventy miles north of Fort Steele, British Columbia. They
arrived here October 9, 1905, and up to this date they have
thriven as well, and grown as rapidly, as they would have
in a state of nature. Their food consists of the best clover
hay obtainable, and crushed oats. When they shed their
coats, in the spring, they are almost as white as snow, but
with months of use, their pelage becomes soiled and slightly
discolored.</p>
<p>A fully adult male mountain goat stands from 39 to 41
inches in shoulder height, and weighs, <i>on scales</i>, from 258 to
300 pounds.</p>
<h3 id="c13">THE PRONG-HORNED ANTELOPE.</h3>
<p><b>The Prong-Horned Antelope</b>, (<i>Antilocapra americana</i>), is
an animal in which Americans should now take special interest.
Structurally, the Prong-Horn is so peculiar that it has
been found necessary to create for it a special zoological
family, called <i>Antilocapridae</i>, of which it is the sole member.
This is due to the following facts: (1) This is
the only living mammal possessing hollow horns (growing
over a bony core) which sheds them annually; (2) it
is the only animal possessing a hollow horn which bears a
prong, or bifurcation; (3) it has no &ldquo;dew claws,&rdquo; as
other ruminant animals have; (4) the horn is placed
directly above the eye; (5) the long hair of the body
and neck is tubular; and (6) that on the rump is erectile.
Beyond all possibility of doubt, it will be our next large
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
species to become extinct, and if we may judge by the
rate at which the bands have been disappearing during the
last fifteen years, ten years more will, in all probability, witness
the extermination of the last individuals now struggling
to exist outside of rigidly protected areas. It was the intention
of the Society to make liberal provision for the study of
the species while it is yet possible to obtain living specimens,
for fifty years hence our graceful and zoologically interesting
Prong-Horn will be as extinct as the dodo. Unfortunately,
however, it fares so badly on the Atlantic coast,
there will, no doubt, be periods wherein this species will be
temporarily absent from the Park.</p>

<p>Forty years ago this animal inhabited practically the
whole of the great pasture region which stretches eastward
from the Rocky Mountains to the western borders of Iowa
and Missouri. Northward its range extended far into Manitoba;
southward it went far beyond the Rio Grande, and it
also ranged southwestward through Colorado and Nevada
to southern California. Its chosen home was the treeless
plains, where the rich buffalo grass and bunch grass
afforded abundant food, but it also frequented the beautiful
mountain parks of Wyoming and Colorado. It even
lived contentedly in the deserts of the southwest, where its
voluntary presence, coupled with the absence of water, constituted
a problem which has puzzled the brain of many
a desert traveller.</p>

<p>To-day, all observers agree that in all regions wherein the
antelope are not rigidly protected, they are going fast.
Those in the Yellowstone Park are protected against man
only to be devoured by the wolves which infest the Park.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Prong-Horned Antelope is not a hardy
animal. The kids are very difficult to rear; they are at all
times easily hurt by accident, and even in a state of nature
this species suffers more severely in winter than any other
North American ruminant. Often the herds drift helplessly
before the blizzards, with numerous deaths from freezing
and starvation, and in spring the survivors come out thin
and weak.</p>
<h3 id="c14">THE CAMEL HOUSE, No. 39.</h3>
<p>Speaking in a collective sense, the Camel is much more
than an ordinary animal unit in a zoological park. On the
high plains of central and southwestern Asia, and throughout
the arid regions of Africa, it is an institution. Without
it, many portions of the Old World would be uninhabitable
by man. Take either Dromedary or Bactrian Camel, and it
is a sad-eyed, ungainly, slow-moving creature, full of plaints
and objections; but remember that it goes so far back toward
the foundations of man&rsquo;s dynasty, that beside it the
oldest American history seems but a record of yesterday.
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
It is only a species of the utmost tenacity which could for
fifty centuries or more withstand constant use and abuse
by man without being altered out of all resemblance to its
original form. All races of mankind and all breeds of
domestic animals save one, change and continue to change,
indefinitely, but the Camels apparently go on the same,
forever.</p>

<p><b>The Bactrian Camel</b>, (<i>Camelus bactrianus</i>), he of the long
shaggy hair&mdash;<i>when not shedding</i>&mdash;and the two great humps,
is the beast of heavy burden, the four-footed freight-car of
the desert sands. He can carry 550 pounds of freight, for
three or four days between drinks; but a swift pace is not
for him. It is an animal of this remarkable species, from
distant Turkestan, southwestern Asia, which daily in fine
weather offers its services as a riding animal, at the stand
near the Large Bird-House.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the Bactrian Camel is in its finest
pelage only in winter, when visitors to the Park are few,
and camel-riding is out of the question. Promptly upon the
approach of warm weather and a million visitors, it sheds
its long, shaggy brown coat, and stands forth as if shorn by
a shearer. Of this species, the Zoological Society possesses
two fine specimens (the gift of Captain John S. Barnes), one
of which will at all times be found regularly exhibited at
the Camel House, close by the Crotona (southwest) Entrance.</p>

<h3 id="c15">THE LLAMA HOUSE, No. 38.</h3>

<p>The arid regions of South America are inhabited by four
species of long-necked, long-haired, soft-footed animals, so
closely related to the camels of the Old World that they are
called <i>cameloids</i>. There are four species. The llama and
alpaca are in a state of domestication, and are supposed to
have been derived from the wild guanaco and vicunia. All
of them might almost be described as small-sized, humpless
camels; and their tempers and mental traits are as odd
as their forms.</p>
<p>The ordinary cameloid is a quiet and inoffensive creature;
but the exception is a rogue of rogues. It will bite with the
persistence of a bull-dog, and with its massive, chisel-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
lower incisors inflicts ugly wounds. At times a llama or
vicunia becomes actually insane, and seeks to destroy every
living creature within its reach. Regardless of punishment,
such creatures attack their keepers and their herd-mates,
spit upon visitors, and rage up and down their corrals in
most absurd fashion. Occasionally such individuals require
to be completely isolated.</p>
<p><b>The Llama</b>, (<i>Lama glama</i>), is the largest and strongest
member of the group. Its body is covered with a thick
mass of long, wavy hair of fine texture, which may be either
brown, white, white and brown, or almost black. The head
and legs are short-haired like those of the guanaco. From
time immemorial, this animal has been used as a beast of
burden, and in the Andes has played an important part in
the mineral industry by carrying silver ore and bullion from
the mines.</p>
<p><b>The Alpaca</b>, (<i>Lama pacos</i>), is bred for its wool. It is
smaller than the llama, but more abundantly haired on the
legs, neck and head. Its fleece is long, and lies in stringy
tufts. Usually its color is dark brown or black, but occasionally
a white Alpaca is seen. A white specimen in the
Zoological Park collection has blue eyes.</p>
<p><b>The Guanaco</b>, (<i>Lama guanacus</i>), is one of the most interesting
and valuable wild animals now found in Patagonia.
Unfortunately, it is so stupid and incapable that it is easily
killed. The natives of Terra del Fuego, themselves almost
the lowest and most ignorant of men, slaughter Guanacos
for food by surrounding groups of them and clubbing them
to death.</p>
<p>In size the Guanaco is between the llama and vicunia,
and its shoulder height is about 4 feet. Its hair is thick and
woolly, of a pale reddish color, and there are naked patches
on the legs. This species is found on the Andes, from Ecuador
to Terra del Fuego, and appears to be most abundant in
Patagonia.</p>
<p><b>The Vicunia</b>, (<i>Lama vicunia</i>), is the only member of the
cameloid group which is not clothed with a mass of long
hair. It is the smallest member of the group, comparatively
short-haired, its color is a uniform light brown, its head is
small, and there are no callosities on the hind legs. The
Vicunia is found from southern Ecuador, through Peru to
central Bolivia.</p>

<h3 id="c16">NORTH AMERICAN DEER.
<br />Elk, Mule Deer, White-Tail, Caribou and Moose.</h3>
<p>The American members of the Deer Family will be found
in the ranges situated on the hill west of the Wild-Fowl
Pond, stretching from the Llama House northward to the
Service Road.</p>
<p>After several years of experiments, we must admit that to
all the American members of the Deer Family save the wapiti
white-tailed and mule deer, the climate of New York City is
decidedly inimical. This densely humid and extremely saline
atmosphere is about as deadly to the black-tail, caribou
and moose as it is to the Eskimo; and thus far we have
found it an absolute impossibility to maintain satisfactory
herds of those species in the ranges available for them. In
great tracts of forests, some of them might become acclimatized;
but, be that as it may, all experiments made thus far
both here and in two of the great game preserves of New
England, prove conclusively that black-tail deer, mule deer,
caribou, moose, and also prong-horned antelope, are among
the most difficult of all ruminants to acclimatize anywhere
in the United States eastward of the great plains.</p>
<p>Although the Zoological Society will continue its experiments
with some of these preserve species, and will always
strive to exhibit some of them, our original hopes regarding
them have been abandoned. We are certain that the difficulty
lies not in the food, but in climate conditions, that are
beyond our control, and especially our very salty atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>The American Elk, or Wapiti</b>, (<i>Cervus canadensis.</i>)&mdash;Of
all the numerous members of the Deer Family, this animal is
second in size to the moose only; and in the autumn, when
its pelage is bright and luxuriant, its sides well rounded, its
massive antlers clean and held conspicuously aloft, the elk
may justly be called the king of the <i>Cervidae</i>. It is well
that in the Yellowstone Park we have an unfailing supply
of Elk, which bids fair to perpetuate this handsome species
for another century.</p>
<p>Our Elk Range might well stand for a mountain park, in
which is set a natural lakelet of real value. In October,
when the splendid groves of beech, oak, and maple along
the eastern ridge put on all the glorious tints of autumn,
and the big thicket of sumacs, ash, and haw on the northern
hill fairly blaze with scarlet&mdash;then are the elk also at their
best. There is no finer picture in animate nature than a
herd of elk in October, with such a setting of greensward,
tree-trunk, and foliage.</p>

<p class="pcap">EUROPEAN RED DEER.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>The maximum shoulder height of the Elk is 5 feet 4
inches, or thereabouts, and the heaviest weight noted thus
far is 927 pounds.</p>
<p>The calves are born from May to July, and are spotted
during the first six months. During the first year the antlers
are merely two straight spikes, called &ldquo;dag antlers.&rdquo;
As in all members of the Deer Family, the antlers are shed
every year&mdash;which to many persons is almost beyond belief.
Any person who visits a zoological garden in midsummer
will see that the old antlers have dropped off bodily,
just below the burr, and that new antlers, covered with hair,
soft, full of blood, and with club-like &ldquo;points,&rdquo; have sprung
up like mushrooms in place of the old ones. In supplying
the great drain on the system necessary to support this remarkable
growth, the Elk grows thin, and the fear of hurting
his tender young antlers makes him quite timid and inoffensive.
He is no longer the tyrant of the herd, and a constant
menace to his keepers.</p>
<p>At this point it is not amiss to call attention to the differences
between <i>horns</i> and <i>antlers</i>.</p>
<p>A <i>horn</i> is a hollow sheath, growing over a bony core, and
except in the case of the prong-horned antelope, is never
shed. Horns are worn by both sexes of all bison, buffaloes,
cattle, antelope, sheep, and goats.</p>
<p>An <i>antler</i> is of solid bone throughout, growing from the
skull; it is shed every year close to the skull, and quickly
renewed. Usually antlers have several branches. They are
worn by nearly all male members of the Deer Family&mdash;moose,
elk, caribou, deer, etc., and also by the female caribou. The
prongs on an antler are no index of the wearer&rsquo;s age. Some
of the finest and most massive elk antlers have only twelve
or fourteen points. During August and September the hairy
covering, or &ldquo;velvet,&rdquo; of new antlers is rubbed off against
trees and bushes. This period is quickly followed by the
mating season, during which the neck of the bull becomes
unusually large, and often the animal becomes dangerous.</p>
<p>Although the Elk is essentially a timber-loving animal, it
also wandered far into the plains bordering the Rocky
Mountains on the east&mdash;until driven from them by man.
The ideal home of this animal is the timbered foothills of
our western mountains, up to 8,000 feet. Although once
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
found from Virginia and New York to Oregon, and from
northern Manitoba to the Gulf of Mexico, it is now numerous
only in and adjacent to the Yellowstone Park, in central
Colorado, where it is well protected, and in western
Manitoba. The number of Elk in the National Park is
variously estimated at from 10,000 head to a much larger
number.</p>
<p>In a wild state, the Elk feeds on grasses, weeds, and the
leaves and twigs of various trees and shrubs. Of all American
deer, it is the most easy to acclimate and breed in
captivity. Large herds are now being maintained and
bred in numerous private game preserves in New Hampshire,
New York, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and elsewhere.
About 200 head have been released in the Adirondacks.</p>
<p><b>The Mule Deer</b>, (<i>Odocoileus hemionus.</i>)&mdash;This fine animal
is universally known throughout the Rocky Mountain region,
which constitutes its home, as the &ldquo;Black-Tailed Deer.&rdquo;
Because of its very large ears, <i>and the absence of a black
tail</i>, it is known to naturalists as the Mule Deer. Inasmuch
as its tail is not black, the above more common name properly
applies to <i>Odocoileus columbianus</i>, the true black-tailed
deer of the Pacific coast. In Manitoba this animal is called
the &ldquo;Jumping Deer,&rdquo; because when running at a gallop, it
makes a series of stiff-legged jumps, or &ldquo;bucks,&rdquo; of great
length.</p>
<p>The weight of full-grown bucks ranges from 250 to 300
pounds, and specimens have been known to reach 325
pounds. The antlers of the Mule Deer are larger and handsomer
than those of the white-tailed deer, and are much
better poised on the head. Instead of dropping forward,
they partake more of the set of an elk&rsquo;s antlers, and many
a &ldquo;tenderfoot&rdquo; hunter has mistaken a heavily-antlered
Mule Deer for an elk. The antlers of a Mule Deer are
easily distinguished from those of the white-tailed species
by the two Y-shaped prongs on each antler. It will be remembered
that instead of these, the white-tailed deer antler
bears three straight, perpendicular spikes.</p>
<p>The Mule Deer makes its home in rugged ravines and
bad lands so common along the creeks and rivers of the
Rocky Mountain region, extending well eastward into the
plains. Of late years it has been driven out of the most
accessible of its former haunts, and forced to take shelter
in the rugged fastnesses of the foothills and mountains.
West of the Rocky Mountains it was formerly found along
the whole Pacific slope, from Cape St. Lucas to British
Columbia, although in northern California it is almost replaced
by the <b>Columbian Black-Tail</b>, (<i>O. columbianus</i>).</p>

<p class="pcap">DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANTLERS OF A MALE DEER.</p>
<p class="pcapc">These pictures show the stages of growth of the antlers from the
time the old ones are dropped, to the full development. Number 1 shows
the bull with the one antler gone&mdash;picture made early in March. Number

<p><b>The White-Tailed Deer</b>, (<i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>), is the
species most widely known throughout the United States,
partly by reason of the fact that it was the first species
with which the early settlers of America became acquainted,
partly because of its wide distribution, and also its persistence
in holding its own. In various localities this animal
is known under various names, such as &ldquo;White-Tailed Deer,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Flag-Tailed Deer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fan-Tailed Deer.&rdquo; Although not
at all in need of it, quite recently it has received still another
name&mdash;American Deer. The small deer of Florida,
and also of New Mexico and the Southwest, have been
described as separate forms; and if size is to be accepted
as a factor in the differentiation of species, the diminutive
proportions of the proposed southern species are quite sufficient
to establish their separate identity.</p>
<p>The White-Tailed deer of Virginia and the northern United
States is a fine animal&mdash;large, strong-limbed, heavily-antlered,
and hardy. Between it and the deer of Florida the
difference is as great as that between a setter dog and a mastiff.
Thanks to the fact that this species is a born skulker
and lives only in thick brush and timber, it still holds its
own throughout the forest regions of the South generally,
Pennsylvania, the Adirondacks, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota,
the Dakotas, Montana, and Colorado. In the West
it is often found inhabiting brushy ravines and river bottoms.</p>
<p>This species breeds readily in confinement, and when protected
in any large tract of brush or timber, increases
rapidly. During the months of September, October, and
November, the bucks are dangerous and untrustworthy.
The peculiar formation of the antlers&mdash;three strong, spear-like
points thrust straight upward from the beam&mdash;makes
them dangerous weapons; and when an ill-tempered buck
lowers his chin and drives straight forward with eight
sharp spears of solid bone, and nearly three hundred pounds
of weight to back them, he may well be considered a dangerous
animal. He is to be feared less than the elk only
because he is smaller.</p>
<p><b>The Woodland Caribou</b>, (<i>Rangifer caribou</i>).&mdash;The first
hoofed animal to arrive at the Zoological Park was a young
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
female of this species, which was procured in Champlain
County, Canada, and forwarded to the Society by one of
our members, Mr. George S. Huntington. These animals,
when present in the Park, will be kept in a small enclosure,
because a large range containing an abundance of
green grass is fatal to them.</p>
<p>The wild range of the Woodland Caribou extends from
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Maine, with many wide
gaps, to the head waters of the Yukon River, in southern
Alaska. The following localities are worthy of special mention:
northern Quebec and Ontario; James Bay; the northern
end of Lake Winnipeg (occasionally); Lake of Woods,
Minnesota; Oregon near Mount Hood; northern Idaho;
northwestern Montana, and the mountains of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Quite recently, three new species of caribou have been
added to our fauna, one from the Alaskan Peninsula (<i>Rangifer
granti</i>), one from the Kenai Peninsula (<i>Rangifer stonei</i>),
and one from the Cassiar Mountains (<i>Rangifer osborni</i>).</p>
<p>The Woodland Caribou attains nearly twice the bodily
bulk of its more northern congener, the Barren-Ground
caribou. In a state of nature it lives on browse, reindeer
moss, tree moss, and lichens, and it loves ice-covered lakes
and ponds as much as any boy. Its loose-jointed and wide
spreading hoofs and enormously developed &ldquo;dew-claws&rdquo;
have been specially designed by Nature to enable this animal
to run freely, as if on snow-shoes, over snow or bogs,
which to any small-hoofed deer would be quite impassable.</p>
<p>The female Woodland Caribou is provided with small antlers,
which, like those of the male, are shed and renewed
annually.</p>
<p>In the absence of caribou in the Park, visitors are advised
to look for specimens of the <b>Lapland Reindeer</b>, (<i>Rangifer
tarandus</i>), for we shall endeavor to keep this genus represented.</p>
<h3 id="c17">THE ZEBRA HOUSES, No. 14.</h3>
<p>Although the main building of this installation has not
yet been erected, the plan for the various buildings and
corrals has been approved, and the main building was
begun in 1911 and completed in 1912. The three buildings,
and the extensive corrals connecting with them, as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
whole, do justice to the important and picturesque Family
<i>Equidae</i>, which includes all the zebras, wild asses and wild
horses of the world.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">

<p class="pcap">GRANT ZEBRA.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Prjevalsky Horses</b>, (<i>Equus prjevalskii</i>).&mdash;Of all the
wild equines which either now or hereafter may be seen in
the Zoological Park, the strange little wild horses from
western Mongolia are, and probably will remain, the most
interesting, from a zoological point of view. Broadly speaking,
they are the connecting link between the many-striped
zebras, the little-striped quaggas and the wild asses on one
side, and the domestic, unstriped horse on the other. These
wild horses possess a narrow, dark dorsal stripe, which, in
the winter pelage is scarcely visible, but in summer is plainly
evident. A perfect specimen has an erect mane, no long
forelock and no &ldquo;chestnuts&rdquo; on its legs. On the upper
half of its tail the hair is short, and mule-like, but on the
lower, or terminal half, it is long and horse-like. The winter
coat of this animal is very long and shaggy.</p>
<p><b>Mountain Zebra</b>, (<i>Equus zebra</i>).&mdash;This species has been
nearly exterminated by man, and is rarely seen in captivity.
It inhabits the mountains of Cape Colony, and it is estimated
that only 400 individuals remain, which now are carefully
protected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>

<p class="pcap">PRJEVALSKY HORSES.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Grevy Zebra</b>, (<i>Equus grevyi</i>).&mdash;This picturesque species
was discovered in Abyssinia, when Jules Grevy was president
of France, and it was named in his honor. It is of
large size, covered with very narrow stripes all over its body,
head and limbs, and its huge ears are of remarkable form.
This species is limited to southern Abyssinia and British
East Africa southward to the Tana River.</p>
<p><b>Grant Zebra</b>, (<i>Equus burchelli granti</i>).&mdash;Of all the zebras
now seen in captivity, the great majority belong to what
very properly may be designated as the group of Burchell
Zebras. This group contains, besides the type species, which
has practically no stripes on its legs, four subspecies, whose
legs are more or less striped, and which may or may not
possess &ldquo;shadow stripes&rdquo; on the hind-quarters. A &ldquo;shadow
stripe&rdquo; is a faint, dark stripe in the middle of a wide white
or pale yellow stripe which lies between two broad black
stripes.</p>
<p>Grant Zebra is the most heavily striped of the subspecies
composing the Burchell group. The visitor will observe
that its horizontal leg-stripes are very pronounced, and so
numerous that they are carried quite down to the hoofs.
The ground-color of the animal is a cold white, and the
thigh and body stripes are very wide and intense. This
fine pair was captured in Masailand, East Africa, in 1902.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p><b>Chapman Zebra</b>, (<i>Equus burchelli chapmani</i>), also belongs
to the Burchell group, and in its color pattern it approaches
quite nearly to the type. The legs of the male bear a few
stripes, those of the female almost none. There are visible on
the hind-quarters of the female a few faint shadow-stripes.</p>
<p><b>The Persian Wild Ass</b>, (<i>Equus persicus</i>), is a very satisfactory
representative of the wild asses generally. Its dorsal-stripe
is very wide and sharply defined, but it bears no
shoulder-stripe, and those that are faintly indicated on its
legs are nothing more than oblong blotches of dark color.
As its name implies, it inhabits Persia, and Syria, and a
closely related form, the <b>Onager</b>, (<i>E. onager</i>), is found in
Beluchistan and western India. A third species, the <b>Kiang</b>
(<i>E. hemionus</i>), is found on the plains of Tibet.</p>
<h3 id="c18">THE ASIATIC AND EUROPEAN DEER, Nos. 1-3.</h3>
<p>In representatives of the deer, (Family <i>Cervidae</i>), Asia
far surpasses all other countries. Her species number about
38,&mdash;fully double that of any other continental area,&mdash;and
from the great Altai wapiti to the tiny musk deer, the variations
in size and form are fairly bewildering. The entire
hill that rises between the Fordham Entrance and Bird
Valley, from Cope Lake to the Zebra Houses, is devoted
to the series of houses, corrals and ranges that are occupied
by the deer of Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>It is quite certain that a number of desirable species of
Asiatic deer can successfully be acclimatized in the parks
and game preserves of America, and induced to breed. Almost
without an exception they are strong and vigorous
feeders, and they keep fat and sleek when our own black-tail,
mule deer and white-tail mince like pampered epicures,
grow thinner and thinner, and finally die of &ldquo;malnutrition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believing that the members of the group amply justify
the effort, the Zoological Society has been at considerable
pains to bring together a fine, representative collection of
the Old World <i>Cervidae</i> and properly install its members.
Although the series proposed is not quite complete, it contains
such rarities as the Altai Wapiti, Barasingha, Burmese
Thameng, Malay and Indian Sambar, and several others.
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
They are sheltered by four houses, the largest of which
crowns the summit of the hill on the right of Osborn
Walk as the visitor enters from Fordham. For the visitors&rsquo;
convenience we will make note of the various species about
in the order of their appearance, and not in zoological sequence.</p>
<p><b>The Axis Deer</b>, (<i>Axis axis</i>), is the handsomest of all the
tropical deer. Indeed, it may even be said to be the only
species of the tropics possessing both form and pelage which
are alike pleasing to the eye. In contrast with the many
beautiful and splendidly colored antelopes of Africa, the
deer of the tropics, all round the world, are poorly provided
with those characters which make a handsome animal.
With the sole exception of the Axis Deer, nearly all the
other deer of the East Indies have thin, coarse, dull-colored
hair, their antlers are small, and seldom have more than four
points. This is equally true of the deer of Mexico, Central
and South America. Even our own white-tailed deer, so
lusty and fine in the North, becomes in Florida and Texas so
dwarfed that it has now been called a subspecies.</p>
<p>Considering the severe plainness of all the other deer in
the tropics, it is a little strange that the coat of the Axis
should be the most beautiful possessed by any deer. But it
is quite true; and apart from the majesty of the elk, there
is no more beautiful sight in cervine life than the picture
offered by a herd of Axis Deer feeding in a sunlit glade
surrounded by forest.</p>
<p>This species adapts itself to out-door life in the temperate
zone with surprising readiness, not even second in that
respect to the eland. As a matter of course the Axis can not
withstand the fierce blizzards of midwinter as do the elk
and other northern deer; but a reasonable degree of care
in providing it with a dry barn, and shelter from cold winds,
enables it to live even as far north as northern Germany
with perfect comfort. In winter our Axis Deer barn is moderately
heated by a stove.</p>
<p><b>The Japanese Sika Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus sika typicus</i>), is a small
representative of a large group of deer species inhabiting
far-eastern Asia, and known as the Sika Deer group. A
ridiculous number of forms have been described as species
and subspecies, of which possibly one-third are entitled to
stand. Some of those on the Asian mainland, as the Pekin
Sika Deer, are much larger than the Japanese Sika, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
also more strikingly colored. The latter species, shown in
our northernmost corral, is about 33 inches in height, and of
a dull and uninteresting smoky-brown color. Its antlers
are quite large for a deer so small, and in the mating season
males are sometimes dangerous. This species is very hardy,
breeds persistently, requires no heat in winter, and very
rarely sends a case to the hospital.</p>

<p class="pcap">AXIS DEER.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Fallow Deer</b>, (<i>Dama vulgaris</i>), is the type of a distinct
group of deer which are distinguished by the possession
of antlers widely palmated throughout the upper half
of the beam. In some old Fallow bucks the antlers are
quite moose-like, and give this small deer an imposing appearance
far out of proportion to its actual size. The
weight of a large buck in prime condition generally is between
180 and 200 pounds, and its shoulder height is
between 36 and 40 inches. The largest antlers recorded
by Mr. J. G. Millais, in his beautiful work on &ldquo;The British
Deer,&rdquo; measured 29&frac12; inches in length, 28&frac12; inches spread,
width of palmation 8 inches, and the number of points 14.
The extinct Irish elk, with the most colossal antlers ever
carried by a cervine animal, was a near relative of the
two living species of Fallow Deer.</p>
<p>Although a native of northern Africa and the north shore
of the Mediterranean, the Fallow Deer was acclimatized in
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
England and northern Europe so long ago that the exact
date records of the event have disappeared, and the species
is now at home in very many European forests and game
preserves. The deer parks in England possess many fine
herds, but they sometimes exhibit one unfortunate result of
long breeding in a semi-domesticated state&mdash;departure from
the original type.</p>
<p>The typical Fallow Deer is in winter very dark brown,
with light brown legs and under parts, and in summer light
red with white spots&mdash;quite like the axis. From this standard,
the variations run from pure white through the color
of the wild type to jet black.</p>
<p>The fine herd in the Zoological Park is the gift of Mr.
William Rockefeller. Six of its original members came
from the donor&rsquo;s herd at Greenwich, Connecticut, and six
were purchased from one of the imperial parks of Russia,
by consent of the Czar, and represent the most hardy stock
obtainable.</p>

<p class="pcap">BURMESE DEER.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Burmese, or Eld Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus eldi</i>), also known as
the <b>Brow-Antler Deer</b>, is one of the rarest species to be seen
in captivity. Living specimens are acquired only through
special expeditions to northern Burma. Its most characteristic
feature is the antlers of the male, which sends
forward a very long and almost straight brow tine, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
the main beam sweeps backward in the opposite direction,
and describes a full semicircle. The antlers are both very
heavy and long for the size of the animal. The specimens
shown here, which are breeding satisfactorily, are the gift of
Mr. William Rockefeller.</p>
<p><b>The Barasingha Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus duvauceli</i>), also called the
<b>Swamp Deer</b>, is to India what the mule deer is to North
America. To my mind, the antlers of the former always
suggests the latter species, and in size the two species are
much alike. In summer the coat of the Barasingha is of a
beautiful golden-yellow color, conspicuous from afar, and
the antlers of old males reach a length of from 35 to 41
inches, with three bifurcations on each beam. The antlers
sometimes are shed and renewed twice in twelve months.
With us this species breeds very regularly, and the offspring
mature well.</p>
<p><b>The Altai Wapiti</b>, (<i>Cervus canadensis asiaticus</i>), is, in all
probability, the parent stock of our American elk, but it
happens to be a fact that our species was the first to be
discovered by systematic zoologists, and described. To all
visitors who are interested in deer, the Altai Wapiti&mdash;and
also the <b>Tashkent Wapiti</b>&mdash;are a constant source of wonder,
because of their well-nigh perfect similarity in all points
to our own wapiti, or American elk. Our Asiatic wapiti
are exhibited in ranges connecting with the western rooms
of the Asiatic Deer House, where they have bred twice, and
produced two fine fawns. In the rutting season the males
are very cross and dangerous. They are hardy, and require
no heat in winter.</p>
<p><b>The Indian Sambar</b>, (<i>Cervus unicolor</i>), always suggests a
tropical understudy of the Altai wapiti, clad with thin,
coarse, bristly hair, and with shorter and smaller antlers,
and a bristly mane all over the neck. Each antler possesses
three points, only. Of all the Old World <i>Cervidae</i>, this
species most nearly approaches the size of the Altai and
Tashkent wapiti. It inhabits the hill forests of India, and
in Burma, Siam and farther south it is replaced by the next
species.</p>
<p><b>The Malay Sambar</b>, (<i>Cervus equinus</i>), also called&mdash;most
inappropriately&mdash;the &ldquo;<b>Horse-Tailed Deer</b>,&rdquo; very strongly
resembles the preceding species, except that the bristly
mane of the former is generally absent. The antlers of
this species are shorter, also, but very thick in proportion
to their length. The Malay Sambar is confined to the Malay
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Peninsula and the countries immediately above, and Borneo
and Sumatra.</p>
<p>This species possesses many admirable qualities, and it
might be introduced to advantage in our southern states.
It is very even-tempered and sensible, easily handled, is
a vigorous feeder, breeds persistently, and matures very
rapidly; but in every New York winter, it requires some
heat in its barn.</p>
<p><b>The Maral Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus maral</i>), is in appearance like an
extra large red deer or a small elk. It is a midway member
of the Wapiti group, which extends in a somewhat
broken chain from Colorado, northward across Bering Strait
to Asia, and thence across Asia and Europe to Scotland.
We have owned a fine pair of Maral Deer, from the Caucasus
district, but they have failed to breed as expected.</p>
<p><b>The European Red Deer</b>, (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>), is an understudy
of the American elk, which it much resembles in
form and in habits. Next to the elk it is the finest living
deer, and for many generations has held its own against
the dangers of in-breeding. In the parks and forest preserves
of Great Britain and Europe, it exists abundantly,
but only as private property, subject to the guns of the
owner and his friends. This species has been successfully
crossed with the American elk.</p>
<p>Other Asiatic Deer will be found in the Small-Deer House,
in the southern end of the Park.</p>
<h3 id="c19">THE LION HOUSE, No. 15.</h3>
<p>As a spectacle of captive animal life, there is none more
inspiring than a spacious, well-lighted and finely-appointed
lion house, filled with a collection of the world&rsquo;s greatest
and handsomest wild beasts. To build an ideal lion house,
and to fill it with a first-class collection of large felines, are
matters involving no little time and much money; but the
sight,&mdash;for the millions of visitors,&mdash;of lions, tigers, jaguars,
pumas, leopards, cheetahs, black leopards, snow leopards
and clouded leopards, all under one roof, surely is worth
what it costs.</p>
<p>The Lion House of the Zoological Park was completed,
excepting a few minor details, early in the year 1903, and
was formally opened to the public in February. It is 244
feet long, 115 feet wide, including the outdoor cages, and its
cost when completed reached $150,000. The materials of
the building are the same kind as those used in the Reptile
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
House and Primate House, but the animal sculptures,
all by Mr. Eli Harvey, are more abundant and conspicuous
than on any other structure erected heretofore. The building
contains 13 indoor cages, and 9 outdoor cages, and between
the two there is free communication. The sizes of
the various cages are as follows:</p>
<p>Interior cages: Largest, 14 feet wide, 22 feet deep; smallest,
13 feet wide, 14 feet high.</p>
<p>Exterior cages: two end cages, 40&times;44 feet, 17 feet high;
central cage, 40 feet square, 14 feet high; smallest, 13 feet
wide, 12 feet deep, 13 feet high.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/pmg048.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="460" />
<p class="pcap">JAGUAR.</p>
</div>
<p>Excepting for the single fact of having interior and exterior
cages, the Lion House of the Zoological Park is&mdash;like
the Primate House&mdash;an entirely original development. Its
most important new features are as follows:</p>
<p>All cage service, the introducing and withdrawal of animals,
is conducted from the rear, by means of a track underneath
the sleeping dens, and an elevating platform car.</p>
<p>The communication between indoor and outdoor cages is
direct and continuous.</p>
<p>Instead of upright iron bars, all the cage fronts are of
hard-steel wire netting, in rectangular pattern, attached to
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
wrought iron frames. This is considered by the Zoological
Society a great improvement upon the heavy bar-work
hitherto in universal use for cage fronts in lion houses.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig42">
<img src="images/pmg049.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="470" />
<p class="pcap">CHEETAH.</p>
</div>
<p>The space above the sleeping dens has been developed
as a sunlit balcony, whereon the animals will be very conspicuous,
even to large crowds of visitors.</p>
<p>Jungle-green tiling, impervious to moisture and dirt, is
used as a back-ground for the animals.</p>
<p><b>The Lion</b> is an animal of perpetual interest, but like
every other noteworthy wild animal, its haunts are constantly
being claimed by civilization, and its members are
rapidly decreasing. It is not a difficult matter to exterminate
or drive out from a given territory any large and
conspicuous quadruped, and at the present rate of settlement
and industrial development in Africa, it may easily
come to pass that by the end of the present century, the
king of beasts will be without a home, outside of zoological
collections.</p>
<p>Like everything great, the Lion has his share of critics
and detractors. A few writers have asserted that because he
does not stalk through his native forests with head proudly
erect, like a drum-major on parade, he is mean-spirited and
cowardly. But the beast of noble countenance believes in
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the survival of the fittest, and both by inheritance and
observation he knows that a lion who needlessly exposes
himself in the field captures the smallest amount of game,
and attracts the greatest number of steel-tipped bullets.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/pmg050.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="391" />
<p class="pcap">BARBARY LION.</p>
</div>
<p>Although Lions vary greatly in their color, and in the
length of the mane, it is conceded by naturalists that only
one species exists. In the same district and under precisely
similar conditions are found short-maned and long-maned
individuals, and all shades of color from tawny yellow to
dark brown. The present geographic range of the species
is from Southern Rhodesia to Persia and northwestern
India, but in northern Egypt there is a large extent of
territory which is lionless.</p>
<p>By reason of his heavy mane and massive countenance,
supported by the grandest roar that issues from throat of
beast, the Lion appears to be a larger animal than he really
is. It is yet an unsettled question whether it exceeds the
tiger in length, height or weight, and it is certainly true
that in point of size these two species are very evenly
matched.</p>
<p>In captivity, the Lion is reasonably contented, and under
good conditions breeds readily, and lives a goodly number
of years.</p>
<p><b>The Siberian Tiger.</b>&mdash;Strange to say, the tiger ranges
far to the northward of its proper home in Hindustan, even
to Corea, Manchuria and Russian Siberia. In those cold
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
regions the tiger grows to its greatest size, and is clothed
with a dense coat of long and shaggy hair. In collections,
the great northern tigers are the most highly prized. The
Zoological Park has recently acquired from East Siberia
two fine young specimens, born early in 1909, and all the
year round they inhabit the great northern outdoor cage
attached to the Lion House. It is a strange sight to see
tigers living outdoors in winter in New York.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/pmg051.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388" />
<p class="pcap">SNOW LEOPARD.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Tiger</b> will be found upon the earth long after the
lion has disappeared. He is a far better hider, a more skillful
hunter, less given to taking foolish risks, and he does not
advertise his presence and invite his enemies by the bombastic
roaring in which the lion delights to indulge. The
Tiger is an animal of serious mind, and he attends strictly
to business. A lion will stalk out into the open, in broad
day, but the Tiger sticks closely to cover until the friendly
darkness renders it safe to roam abroad.</p>
<p>Despite the density of the population of India, and the
omnipresence of sahibs with rifles of large caliber, the Tiger
still inhabits all India from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas,
the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Burma, Siam, and certain
portions of China up to the region of snows. Corean and
Siberian Tigers are much sought after by zoological gardens,
partly on account of their size, and also because they
are so hardy they are able to live out doors all winter in
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
the temperate zone. The Tiger is not found in Africa, nor
in any country westward of India.</p>
<p>The maximum length attained by this animal, head, body
and tail, is 10 feet 2 inches. A very large specimen
killed by Dr. Hornaday measured 9 feet 8&frac12; inches in length,
stood 3 feet 7 inches high at the shoulders, and weighed, on
the scales, 495 pounds. In India, Tigers are classed according
to their habits, as &ldquo;game-killers,&rdquo; &ldquo;cattle-lifters,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;man-eaters.&rdquo; Fortunately, in comparison with the total
number of these animals, the latter are few and far between.</p>
<p>Of yellow-coated felines, <b>The Jaguar</b>, (<i>Felis onca</i>), is
next in size to the tiger. In South America, it is almost
universally called &ldquo;El Tigre&rdquo; (pronounced Te&rsquo;-gre), which
is Spanish for tiger. Comparatively few Americans are
aware that this superb animal belongs in the fauna of the
United States, but such is the fact. The northern limit of
its distribution is found in southern Texas, where it still
exists in small numbers. In South America it extends to
Patagonia.</p>
<p>The Jaguar is a stocky, heavily-built animal, with a massive
head and powerful forearm. It is a good climber, and
many wonderful stories of its strength have been told and
printed. Among leopards of all kinds it can always be
identified by the great size of the black rosettes on its body,
as well as by its heavy build.</p>
<p>The splendid male specimen, named &ldquo;Senor Lopez,&rdquo; in
honor of a former President of Paraguay, was the first to
arrive for the new Lion House. It was captured in August,
1901, in the wilds of central Paraguay, expressly for us,
through the efforts of Mr. William Mill Butler, of Philadelphia,
and by him presented to the Zoological Park. After
a long journey in small river craft, in a flimsy wooden cage
that several times came near collapsing, the animal reached
Asuncion, was taken to Liverpool by Mr. Butler, and finally
reached New York.</p>
<p><b>The Leopard</b>, (<i>Felis pardus</i>), is fourth in size from the
lion, and is distinguished from the jaguar by smaller spots
and less powerful form. It inhabits both Asia and Africa,
from Japan to Cape Colony. While the species is regarded
as the same throughout that vast extent of territory, it is
undoubtedly true that the Leopards of Africa have smaller
spots and more intense coloring than those of Asia. The
maximum size for this species is a total length of 8 feet,
which is attained only by a very large animal, with a long
tail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Naturally, the Leopard preys upon smaller animals
than those most sought by the lion and tiger. It prefers
small antelopes, and young animals generally, goats and
sheep. When pursued, it is very skilful in hiding, and will
shelter in brushy cover until fairly beaten out.</p>
<p><b>The Black Leopard</b> is the most ill-tempered of all feline
animals&mdash;perpetually snarling and growling, and seeking to
do some one an injury. Naturalists regard it as of the
same species as the common leopard, (<i>Felis pardus</i>), despite
the fact that it is found only in southeastern Asia, and
both in appearance and disposition is totally different
from the typical <i>pardus</i>. With but few exceptions, the
world&rsquo;s supply of Black Leopards comes from Singapore.</p>
<p><b>The Cheetah</b>, or <b>Hunting Leopard</b>, (<i>Cynaelurus jubatus</i>),
is marked by its long legs, slender body, small head, small
spots, and claws that are only partially retractile. Its
structure suggests that of the dogs. It is distributed very
irregularly through portions of Africa and southern Asia,
and is by no means a common animal like the leopard and
tiger.</p>
<p>In central India, this animal is trained to hunt the sasin
antelope, a form of sport indulged in chiefly by native rajahs.
The Cheetah takes kindly to captivity, and permits
handling to an extent quite unknown with other large
felines. Its keepers place the animal upon an open cart,
blindfold it, and then drive to within 200 yards of a herd of
antelope. At the point of nearest possible approach, the
hood is removed, and the animal is set free. Leaping to the
ground, the Cheetah stalks the herd of antelope as closely as
possible, then makes a sudden rush forward, and endeavors
to seize a victim. If successful, the animal is pulled down
and killed. If not, the Cheetah sullenly retires, and again
places itself in the hands of its friends.</p>
<p><b>The Snow Leopard</b>, or <b>Ounce</b>, (<i>Felis uncia</i>), is the rarest,
and also one of the most beautiful of all the large felines.
It inhabits the high plateau of central Asia from the Himalayas
to the Altai Mountains of Mongolia, above 9,000 feet.
It is the neighbor of the Marco Polo sheep, the giant-horned
argali, and the Siberian ibex. In its home country,
this creature is sufficiently numerous that 2,000 tanned skins
sometimes reach Shanghai in a single year, but owing to its
great distance from railways and sea, not more than fifteen
or twenty specimens have reached the zoological gardens of
Europe and America. Some individuals are good-natured
and playful, but others are morose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p><b>The Puma</b>, or <b>Mountain Lion</b>, (<i>Felis concolor</i>), is the
most widely-known feline in North America. At present
it is at home in Florida, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado,
Texas, and all the states westward thereof. Southward it
inhabits Mexico and Central America, and ranges through
South America quite down to southern Patagonia. It attains
its maximum size (8 feet in length, weight 225 pounds)
in Colorado, where it appears to be more numerous than in
any other state. In Routt County it is hunted very successfully
with dogs. When pursued, it is compelled to take
refuge in a low tree, in which it can be photographed or shot
without danger.</p>
<p>Despite the numerous thrilling stories that have been
written and published about the dangerous doings of this
animal, it is by no means really dangerous to man. No
Puma holding an option on a safe line of retreat ever stops
to fight a man.</p>
<p>The Puma was formed for agility rather than strength.
It swims well, and it is the most agile climber of all the
large felines. The head of this animal is particularly beautiful,
and its temper in captivity is entirely satisfactory.
The first specimen of this species to enter the Zoological
Park came from Peru, as a gift from Mr. Joseph P. Grace,
and during the years 1901 and 1902 it lived out doors, constantly,
in the Puma House (No. 33A), where its health was
excellent.</p>
<h3 id="c20">THE SEA-LIONS, No. 12.</h3>
<p>Of all animals which find permanent homes in zoological
gardens and parks, very few afford the public more constant
entertainment than Sea-Lions. They are delightfully
active, and in one way or another&mdash;diving, swimming, climbing
or hopping about&mdash;are nearly always &ldquo;showing off.&rdquo;
No one within a quarter of a mile of their pool need inquire
where they are, for their loud and cheerful &ldquo;Hook! hook!
hook,&rdquo; is heard far and wide, and draws visitors like a
magnet.</p>
<p>The Sea-Lion Pool is situated about in the center of Baird
Court.</p>
<p><b>The California Sea-Lion</b>, or <b>&ldquo;Barking Sea-Lion,&rdquo;</b> (<i>Zalophus
californianus</i>), is the species most easily caught alive,
and the one usually seen in captivity. Its home is the coast
of California, but it is said to enter the Sacramento River
and travel upward for a considerable distance in pursuit of
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
spawning salmon. Comparatively few Sea-Lions are now
found on the mainland coast of California. On the United
States Light-House reservations their slaughter is prohibited
by the Light-House Board.</p>
<p>The California Sea-Lion is very similar in size, and, leaving
the old males out of consideration, it is almost the exact
counterpart in form of that apple of perpetual international
discord&mdash;the Alaskan &ldquo;fur seal.&rdquo; The unfortunate fact that
the latter animal has become known as a &ldquo;seal,&rdquo; has caused
much confusion in people&rsquo;s minds regarding the classification
of pinnipeds (fin-footed animals) generally. For this
reason, it is proper to observe at this point that:</p>
<p><i>Sea-Lions</i> have flat, triangular, naked front flippers,
without claws; they have long necks, and carry their heads
high. There are nine species, of which the so-called &ldquo;fur
seal&rdquo; is one.</p>
<p><i>Seals</i> always have short and stubby front flippers,
which are covered with hair, and provided with claws. In
most species the hair is coarse and valueless. The seal has
a very short neck and by reason of the weakness of its
front flippers, it is not nearly so active nor so interesting
as the sea-lion.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/pmg052.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="392" />
<p class="pcap">ATLANTIC WALRUS.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Atlantic Walrus</b> inhabits the arctic regions between
America and Europe, and it is estimated that not more than
ten specimens ever have been exhibited in captivity. Because
of their unusual feeding habits, Walruses are very
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
difficult to keep alive. Their standard food is clams; and
frequently clams are very difficult to obtain. The Atlantic
Walrus grows to great size, probably exceeding 4,000
pounds in weight. The specimen exhibited in the rocky
pool near the Reptile House was presented by Mr. Paul
J. Rainey, in 1911, and has thriven continuously ever since
its arrival. It was captured in Kane Basin, north of Baffin&rsquo;s
Bay.</p>
<p><b>The Harbor Seal</b>, (<i>Phoca vitulina</i>), is the species common
along our Atlantic coast, and since it serves so well as a
type of hair seals, or true seals, it will occasionally be
shown in the Park. In comparison with the active and
vivacious sea-lion, it is a tame and rather uninteresting
creature; but neither has any commercial value, save for the
purposes of exhibition when alive.</p>
<h3 id="c21">THE PRIMATE HOUSE, No. 17.</h3>
<p>The Primates are the four-handed animals belonging to
the zoological order called by that name, which includes
man, the anthropoid apes both great and small, the baboons,
monkeys and lemurs. The word &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; is by no means
sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all these forms.
Were it otherwise, this building would be called, officially,
the Monkey House.</p>
<p>The Primates include the creatures which stand nearest to
man in the zoological scale, and in interest to all classes of
humanity they stand above all others. There is no intelligent
person, civilized or savage, to whom the humanlikeness
of apes and monkeys does not appeal. On the other hand,
some of the baboons are in feature and temper so thoroughly
beast-like, their diabolism is almost as fascinating as the
man-like character of the great apes. The variety of forms
in the Order Primates, and the wide differences between the
various groups, imperatively demand, for the proper representation
of this Order, a large collection.</p>
<p>The Primate House was erected in 1901, at a cost of
$65,000, and opened to the public on December 22d, of that
year. It is 162 feet in length, 74 feet in width, contains
16 large interior cages, 22 small cages, and 11 exterior cages,
two of which are of great size. The points of special excellence
in this building are as follows: An abundance of
room for the animals, an abundance of sunlight, perfect
ventilation, an extensive series of open-air cages, freedom
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
of communication between outside and inside cages, floors
and walls impervious to moisture and disease germs, and the
absence of iron bars from all cages save three.</p>
<p>During the months of mild weather, all the inmates of the
large interior cages occupy, at will, corresponding cages
in the outdoor series. It is also intended that certain hardy
species of baboons, and the red-faced monkey of Japan,
shall be provided with comfortable sleeping quarters and
live outdoors, every winter. It is believed that they can
do this, not only with comfort, but with great physical
benefit.</p>
<p>For general convenience, and the promotion of a universal
understanding of the primates, we propose to set
them forth in four groups, a subdivision strictly according
to Nature, readily comprehended, and easily remembered
They are as follows, with typical examples of each:</p>

<p>Nearly all the above-named species are now living in the
Primate House, besides which there are many others. So
far as the available supply of captive primates will permit,
these typical species will constantly be kept on exhibition,
together with many others equally interesting. In this
small volume it is possible to notice only the most important
forms.</p>
<p><b>The Gorilla</b>, (<i>Gorilla savagei</i>), of equatorial West Africa,
is the largest and ugliest of the great apes, walks erect, and
in form of body and limbs, it most resembles man. Its
brain, however, is less man-like than that of the chimpanzee
and orang-utan. It is very rarely seen in captivity. The
only specimen which up to 1911 had reached America alive
lived but five days after its arrival. Despite the fact that
these creatures seldom live in captivity longer than a few
months, they are always being sought by zoological gardens.
The agents of the New York Zoological Society are constantly
on the watch for an opportunity to procure and send
hither a good specimen of this wonderful creature; and
whenever one arrives, all persons interested are advised to
see it <i>immediately</i>,&mdash;before it dies of sullenness, lack of
exercise, and indigestion.</p>
<p><b>The Orang-Utan</b> is intellectually superior to the gorilla,
and is equalled only by the chimpanzee. Unfortunately, as
a rule, none of the great apes are long-lived in captivity,
and in zoological gardens they come and go. For this reason,
it is seldom that an adult specimen, 4 feet in height,
and weighing 150 pounds, is seen in captivity. Among
other apes, the Orang-Utan is readily recognized by its
<i>brown skin, red hair and small ears</i>.</p>
<p>In disposition this creature is naturally docile and affectionate.
It is fond of the society of human beings, takes
to training with wonderful readiness and success, and young
specimens can easily be taught to wear clothes, sit at table,
and eat with spoon and fork. In the summer of 1911, the
daily open-air exhibition of <i>nine</i> apes dining at 4 o&rsquo;clock
on an elevated platform in the large outside cage at the
Primate House, will long be remembered by the crowds of
visitors who saw it. Such exhibitions are entirely germane
to the educational purposes of a zoological garden or park,
for they illustrate the mentality of animals and their wonderful
likeness to man, far more forcibly than the best
printed statements.</p>
<p>The north hall of the Primate House is specially intended
for the anthropoid apes, and it is not likely that any
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
lengthy periods will elapse during which it contains neither
orang-utans nor chimpanzees.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/pmg054.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="389" />
<p class="pcap">ORANG-UTAN.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Chimpanzee</b>, (<i>Anthropopithecus calvus</i>), of equatorial
Africa from the west coast to the central lake region, is
quite as common in captivity as the orang-utan. Both
structurally and mentally this animal is very much like the
orang-utan, and for keenness of intellect and susceptibility
to training, it is second to none of the animals lower than
man. A Chimpanzee is easily recognized by its <i>black hair
and large ears</i>. There are two or three species.</p>
<p><b>The Gibbon</b> shows off to poor advantage in a cage, but in
the tree-tops it is a wonderful creature. It is like a long-armed
skeleton clothed with skin and hair, animated by the
spirit of an Ariel. In its home in the jungles of Borneo and
southeastern Asia, it dwells in hilly forests, and never
descends to the earth. When attacked, it flees down-hill, if
possible, and it seems actually to fly through the tree-tops.
It boldly flings itself forward through space, grasps with its
hands the first available branch, swings underneath, feet
foremost, and after another flight presently catches with
its feet, thus actually making revolutions as it goes. Its
progress is so swift and so silent that successful pursuit is
impossible to any enemy not provided with wings.</p>
<p>This animal is naturally very timid, but does not hesitate
to expose itself to mortal danger when its young are in
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
distress. In captivity gibbons are shy and nervous, and
take life very seriously.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Old-World Monkeys.</span></h4>
<p><b>The Baboons</b> have been specially designed by Nature for
life upon the ground, surrounded by dangerous enemies.
But for their big canine teeth, their fierce tempers and bull-dog
courage, backed by a fine combination of strength
and agility, the lions, leopards, hyenas and jackals of
Africa would have exterminated them all, ages ago. They
were not formed to become hand-organ beasts of burden,
nor even companions to man, but rather to fight off their
enemies, and bluff even the king of beasts when occasion
requires. In captivity, their strength and ferocity always
inspires respect, and sometimes genuine terror. At all
times they require to be treated as dangerous animals.</p>
<p>Of the various species of baboons on exhibition in the
Primate House, the full-grown <b>Mandrill</b> is the most interesting,
and wonderful. It seems like an animal not of this
earth, and reminds the visitor of one of the great beasts of
the visions of St. John the Divine. The home of this species
is in West Africa, and it is found from Senegambia to the
Congo. The long shaggy hair, lion-like appearance, the
peculiar color markings of the face, and the indescribable
grimaces, instantly fix the attention of every visitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p><b>The Hamadryas Baboon</b>, with long side whiskers and
cape of long hair, is one of the handsomest animals of this
group. Its explosive, ear-racking cry is almost as startling
to visitors as a cannon-shot.</p>
<p><b>The Golden Baboon</b> has the liveliest disposition and the
best temper possessed by any baboon. Young specimens
are full of good-natured mischief, and are much given to
hectoring their cage-mates. The <b>Long-Armed Yellow Baboon</b>
is quite at home in the Primate House, and has bred
here. It is a good species to keep in captivity.</p>
<p><b>The Group of Old World Monkeys</b>, in addition to the
baboons, contains several species worthy of special remark.
There are some which have tails so very short and insignificant
that they seem to be tailless, and several of them
are called &ldquo;apes.&rdquo; <i>They are not true anthropoids</i> (manlike
apes), however, and it is a confusing error to designate
any of them as &ldquo;apes.&rdquo; The species referred to are the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>The Black &ldquo;Ape,&rdquo;</b> of Celebes, exceedingly like a true
baboon.</p>
<p><b>The Magot, or Barbary &ldquo;Ape,&rdquo;</b> of North Africa and Gibraltar,
which is a true macaque.</p>
<p><b>The Japanese Red-Faced Monkey</b>, another macaque, with
a brilliant red face, and long, thick coat of hair, which
enables it to live out of doors all winter, even in this
Zoological Park.</p>
<p><b>The Pig-Tailed Monkey</b>, several species of which are
found in Burma and other portions of southeastern
Asia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the above are on exhibition in the Primate House,
and the outdoor cages.</p>
<p><b>The Rhesus Monkey</b>, of India, is one of the sacred species,
and ages of immunity from molestation, or even wholesome
discipline, have made this animal aggressive and domineering
in temper.</p>
<p><b>The Bonneted Macaque</b> is the best-tempered monkey of all
the monkey species found in the East Indies, and it is by
far the best to keep as a pet.</p>
<p><b>The Entellus Monkey</b>, of India, is also a sacred species,
and its natural seriousness of manner, and dignified bearing,
quite befit the direct descendants of the original Hunuman,
or monkey deity of the Hindoos, who helped to build Adam&rsquo;s
Bridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Of the many African monkeys, some of the most showy
(such as the Guerzas and Colobos) are so difficult to procure
they can not be set forth as permanent residents in the
Primate House. The following species, however, may be
classed with the reliables:</p>
<p><b>The White-Collared Mangabey</b> and <b>Sooty Mangabey</b> are
both so lively, so good-natured, and so free from the fighting
habit, they are prime favorites with everybody.</p>
<p><b>The Mona Monkey</b> is handsome and easily kept, and an
excellent representative of the great African genus <i>Cercopithecus</i>.</p>
<p><b>The Green Monkey</b> and the <b>Vervet</b> are lively but quarrelsome,
and at times become dangerous. The <b>Patas</b>, or <b>Red
Monkey</b>, is very sedate, and makes a good cage-mate for the
mona.</p>
<p><b>The New World Monkeys</b>, even at their best, never make
a strong showing in a vivarium. The trouble is that many
of the most interesting species are so delicate it is impossible
to keep them alive in captivity. Fame awaits the man who
can discover a bill of fare on which <b>Howling Monkeys</b>, <b>Sakis</b>
and <b>Yarkees</b> can live in captivity to old age, and repay their
cost and care. Their digestive organs are delicate, and are
subject to derangement from causes so slight they can not
be reckoned with.</p>
<p><b>The Sapajous</b> are the hardiest, the most intelligent and
in some respects the most interesting of the New World
monkeys. They all possess the prehensile (or grasping)
tail, <i>which is not found on any Old World monkey</i>, and the
use made of it is a constant source of wonder. Monkeys of
this species are quite common in captivity, and their
wrinkled brows and serious countenances give them an appearance
of being burdened with cares,&mdash;which most captive
monkeys certainly are! These are the unfortunate
creatures which so often come to grief on hand-organs.</p>
<p><b>The Black Spider Monkey</b> and the <b>Gray Spider Monkey</b>
represent a genus of animals quite as attenuated in form
as the gibbons. Their slender bodies, exceedingly long and
slender legs and tail,&mdash;the latter strongly prehensile, and
better than a fifth arm and hand,&mdash;give them when in the
tree-tops an appearance truly spider-like. They are agile
climbers, but not rapid runners, and having no means of
defense are very timid. Their stomachs are so simple they
seem to lack some element or function that is necessary to
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
the life of the animal in captivity. Notwithstanding the
fact that &ldquo;Jess,&rdquo; of Bath, New York, in defiance of all laws
and precedents, <i>lived thirteen years in a cold climate</i>, the
great majority of spider monkeys die before they reach full
maturity, and nearly always of stomach troubles. Fortunately,
however, there are exceptions to this rule.</p>

</div>
<p><b>The Squirrel Monkey</b>, often called a &ldquo;Marmoset,&rdquo; is a
pretty little olive-yellow monkey, almost as delicate as the
true <b>Marmoset</b>, and the <b>Pinche</b>. These diminutive creatures
are so delicate they require the greatest care and tenderness,
and thrive better in moderately small cages than
in large ones. True marmosets are the smallest of American
primates, being next in size to the Tarsier, of Borneo, smallest
of all quadrumanes.</p>
<p><b>The Lemurs and Lemuroids.</b>&mdash;A lemur is a monkey-like
animal belonging to the lowest group of primates, but in
some respects is so little like a typical monkey that the relationship
is not always apparent. There are about thirty
species, and all save a very few are found on the Island of
Madagascar. They are gentle-spirited, harmless and inoffensive
animals, and not being persecuted by their human
neighbors, as all American wild animals are, they are quite
numerous.</p>
<p>Nearly all the Lemurs have long tails, long and fine
hair, large eyes and pointed muzzles. Many of them are
strikingly colored in various shades of black, white and
gray. All Lemurs are supposed to be of nocturnal habit, and
in fact they really are; but the specimens in the large jungle
cage of the Primate House are quite as lively and interesting
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
in the daytime as most of the monkeys. So far from
manifesting a disposition to retire to dark corners, they
love to lie in the sunshine.</p>

<p><b>The Ruffed Lemur, or Black-and-White Lemur</b>, (<i>Lemur
varia</i>), is the handsomest member of this entire group.
Its fur is very long, silky, and alternately pure white and
jet black. <b>The Ring-Tailed Lemur</b> has a very long, pointed
tail, ornamented with about 25 alternating rings of brown
and gray, which it carries very gracefully. This species
is of a more lively disposition than most others. The curious
<b>Indri</b> has not up to this time come into the collection,
but it is expected in the near future. When it arrives it
can at once be recognized by the entire absence of a tail,
except a mere stump, and by its large hands and feet.</p>
<h3 id="c22">ELEPHANT HOUSE, No. 20.</h3>
<p>Of its buildings for animals, the Elephant House is the
culminating feature of the Zoological Park, and it comes
quite near to being the last of the series. In token of these
facts, it is fittingly crowned with a dome. Through its position
in the general plan it closes a wide gap, and effectively
links together the northern and southern halves of the
establishment.</p>
<p>The erection of this great structure began in 1907, and the
building was completed and its inmates housed in the fall
of 1908. The yards surrounding the structure were finished
in 1909.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>

<p class="pcap">ELEPHANT HOUSE.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Any building which can comfortably accommodate a representative
collection of the largest of all living land
animals, must unquestionably be large and substantial. There
is no pleasure in seeing a ponderous elephant chained to
the floor of a small room, unable even to walk to and fro,
and never permitted to roam at will in the open air and sunlight.
It is no wonder that dungeon-kept elephants go mad,
and do mischief. If an elephant&mdash;or for that matter any
animal&mdash;cannot be kept in <i>comfortable</i> captivity, then let it
not be kept at all.</p>
<p>The Elephant House of the City of New York is a large
and roomy structure, built to render good service for two
centuries. Its extreme length over all is 170 feet, and its
width is 84 feet. Its two sides are divided into 8 huge
compartments, of which 4 are for elephants, 2 for rhinoceroses,
and 2 for hippopotami. Each of these is 24&times;21&frac12;
feet.</p>
<p>The Hippopotami have within the building a tank 24&times;21
feet, and 8 feet in total depth; and another will be constructed
in their corral.</p>
<p>Each end of the building furnishes two cages of smaller
dimensions, for tapirs, and young elephants. The whole
area surrounding the building, excepting the axial walk, is
devoted to open-air yards, so arranged that each cage in the
interior connects directly with a corral which affords both
sunshine and shade. Nature seems to have made this beautiful
open grove&mdash;strangely free from trees in its center&mdash;especially
for the purposes to which it now is devoted.</p>
<p>It is by no means the intention of the Zoological Society,
that, because an axial walk leads through the Elephant
House, the building shall be used <i>as a thoroughfare</i> for foot
traffic between the northern and southern portions of the
Park. Such use would surely defeat the main purpose of
the structure. It is intended to be entered <i>only by persons
who desire to see the animals, and all others must pass around
it</i>, by one or the other of the two very direct promenades
which will be provided. The employees of the Park are
strictly forbidden to consider the walk through the building
as a convenient highway, and visitors are requested to
observe the obvious necessities of this case.</p>
<p><b>The Indian Elephant</b>, (<i>Elephas indicus</i>), is the universal
elephant of captivity, the African species being shown only
as a great rarity. For every elephant that comes from
Africa, about thirty come from India, and of those about
twenty-nine are prosy and unromantic females. In order
to secure a male Indian Elephant, it must be specially
ordered.</p>

<p class="pcap">INDIAN ELEPHANT.</p>
</div>
<p>Our first Indian Elephant, a fine male named &ldquo;Gunda,&rdquo;
was caught wild in the interior of Assam, northeastern India,
and he arrived at the Zoological Park in May, 1904,
as the gift of Col. Oliver H. Payne. He was then about
seven years old. He stood 6 feet 7 inches in shoulder
height, weighed 3,740 pounds, and had all the points of a
&ldquo;high-caste&rdquo; elephant. His tusks were then 16 inches long.
He is very mischievous about breaking anything in his
quarters that is breakable, and he manifests special dislike
toward certain individuals who come near him. Like most
Indian elephants, &ldquo;Gunda&rdquo; is very intelligent. In two
days he was taught to receive pennies, lift the lid of his
&ldquo;bank,&rdquo; drop the coin within, and ring his bell.</p>
<p>Since his arrival here, in May, 1904, he has grown in
height at the rate of about 5 inches each year. On November
1, 1910, he stood 8 feet 9 inches in shoulder height, his
weight was 8100 pounds, and his tusks were 36 inches long.</p>
<p><b>The Sudan African Elephant</b>, (<i>Elephas oxyotis</i>, Matschie),
is the largest of the four species of African elephants now
recognized. The other species are the South African Elephant,
(<i>E. capensis</i>), the German-East-African Elephant,
(<i>E. knochenhaueri</i>), and the West African Elephant, (<i>E.
cyclotis</i>).</p>
<p>After some years of waiting, and many futile efforts, we
have at last come into possession of a pair of young Sudan
Elephants, representing, so we believe, the great species to
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
which belonged Jumbo, and also the bearer of the enormous
tusks presented to the Zoological Society by Mr. Charles T.
Barney. Like all elephants newly arrived from Africa,
they are young, and small; but if they have good health
they will grow very rapidly, and about A. D. 1927 they
should attain full stature,&mdash;11 feet at the shoulders for the
male, or thereabouts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig55">
<img src="images/pmg062.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="392" />
<p class="pcap">AFRICAN ELEPHANTS.</p>
</div>
<p>The different species of elephants are most easily recognized
by their ears. Compare the enormous &ldquo;sail-area&rdquo; of
the ears of this species with the small, triangular ear of the
Indian elephant, and the small, round ear of the next species.</p>
<p><b>The West African Elephant</b>, (<i>Elephas cyclotis</i>), of equatorial
West Africa, especially the Congo country, is apparently
a small species, not exceeding seven feet in height, even
if that height is ever attained. Mr. Carl Hagenbeck reports
that out of nearly 300 pairs of tusks of this species
examined by him in the German ivory market, not one pair
exceeded two feet in length, and many measured only 10
inches.</p>
<p>On July 25, 1905, we received a male specimen representing
this species, as a gift from Mr. Barney. It is strikingly
marked by its small round ears, and the presence of 5 toes
on each fore-foot and 4 on the hind foot, the number in the
East African species being 4 and 3, respectively. At the
time of its arrival, little &ldquo;Congo&rdquo; stood 43 inches in shoulder
height, his weight was precisely 600 pounds, and his tusks
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
were 4 inches long. On June 1, 1911, his shoulder height
was 60 inches, and his weight was 1650 pounds, and his
tusks were 23 inches long.</p>

<p class="pcap">AFRICAN TWO-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</p>
</div>
<p>Regarding the life history and distribution of this odd
species, much remains to be ascertained; and precise information
is greatly desired.</p>
<p><b>The African Two-Horned Rhinoceros</b>, (<i>Rhinoceros bicornis</i>),
is already represented by a female specimen which was
acquired in 1906. &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; was captured in July, 1905,
in the northern point of German East Africa, within about
sixty miles of the head of Speke Gulf, which is the southeastern
arm of Lake Victoria Nyanza. The elevation is between
4,000 and 5,000 feet. She was slung under a pole, and
carried, six days&rsquo; journey on men&rsquo;s shoulders, to the shore
of the lake.</p>
<p>From thence she was transported by steamer to Port
Florence, at the head of the Uganda Railway, thence by
rail 500 miles to Mombasa. Ever since her arrival in New
York, &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; has developed rapidly. Captivity does
not seem to fret her in the least. She is very docile, is very
friendly toward her keeper, and it is quite apparent that
she enjoys herself.</p>
<p>The African Two-Horned Rhinoceros once was very abundant
throughout the whole of the fertile plains region of
east and south Africa, but the onslaughts of hunters have
exterminated it from probably nine-tenths of the territory
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
that it once occupied. To-day, the Englishmen of Africa are
earnestly endeavoring to regulate and abate the slaughter
of African big game, and beyond doubt safe, good results
in that line are being accomplished. It is to be hoped that
the protection lines will now be drawn so tightly around
the game that remains that it will be perpetuated for centuries
to come.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/pmg064.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="395" />
<p class="pcap">INDIAN RHINOCEROS.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Indian Rhinoceros</b>, (<i>Rhinoceros unicornis</i>).&mdash;A full-grown
Indian Rhinoceros is one of the most wonderful of all
living animals. It seems like a prehistoric monster, belonging
to the days of the dinosaurs, rather than a creature of
to-day; and the killing of so grand a creature solely for the
sake of &ldquo;sport,&rdquo; and a stuffed head to hang upon a wall, is
murder, no less. It is quite time that the most wonderful
works of animated Nature should universally be recognized
as safe from attack with the rifle and knife.</p>
<p>So pronounced is the rarity of the great Indian Rhinoceros,
it is a fact that for nearly fifteen years no living specimens
came into the wild-animal market. At last, however, the persistence
and industry of the renowned Carl Hagenbeck was
rewarded by the capture, in 1906, of four young specimens,
all of which reached Hamburg in May, 1907. One of the
best specimens of the quartette was purchased for the New
York Zoological Park, and is now living in the Park in the
quarters prepared for him at the Elephant House.</p>

<p class="pcap">PYGMY HIPPOPOTAMI.</p>
</div>
<p>The Indian One-Horned Rhinoceros is the largest of all living
rhinoceroses. A full-grown male is about 5 feet, 6 inches
in shoulder height, and 10 feet 6 inches long from end of
nose to root of tail. The length of the horn is not great,
rarely exceeding 12 inches. The skin is very thick, and lies
upon the animal in great rigid slabs which are divided by
articulating areas of thinner skin.</p>
<p><b>The Hippopotamus</b>, (<i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i>), is more
frequently seen in captivity than any of the large rhinoceroses,
or the African elephant. In the lakes and large rivers
of central East Africa it still exists in fair numbers, and
still is killed for &ldquo;sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, this very inert and usually lethargic
monster can, under what it deems just provocation,
become very angry, and even dangerous. Four years ago,
in one of the rivers of Uganda, a hippopotamus not only
overturned a boat, but killed one of its native occupants by
biting him.</p>
<p>The Hippopotamus breeds readily in captivity, even under
poor conditions, and the supply for the zoological gardens
of the world is chiefly maintained in that way. The fine
male specimen exhibited in the Zoological Park was purchased
from the Central Park Menagerie, for $3,000, and is
a gift from Mr. Samuel Thorne. He was born on July 13,
1904. His weight on November 1, 1909, at five years of age,
was 3,114 pounds; and he is growing rapidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p><b>The Pygmy Hippopotamus</b> (<i>Hippopotamus liberiensis</i>), is
a great zoological novelty, and second in rarity only to the
okapi. Thus far only five specimens ever have been exhibited.
An adult Pygmy Hippo is only <i>one-fourteenth</i>
the size of an adult Nile Hippo. Our three specimens, a
female and two males, are exhibited in the Elephant House.
They arrived in 1912, and were captured in Liberia, West
Africa. The cost price of the trio was $15,000. They have
excellent appetites, never have been ill, and they seem to
enjoy their new home. Their habits, capture, and their
home surroundings have been fully described in the <i>Bulletin</i>
(No. 52) and the Annual Report for 1912 of the Zoological
Society.</p>
<p>The Pygmy Hippopotamus is far more widely distributed
throughout Liberia than might be inferred from the surprising
scarcity of specimens in museums, and the long absence
of the species from zoological gardens. It is an inhabitant
of swampy forests, and while it frequents rivers
it is not confined to them, like the large hippo. It seeks
shelter from molestation in large cavities in river banks,
usually under the roots of overhanging trees. These specimens
were caught by digging pits in their runways, with
sides so steep that the captives could not climb out. After
capture, each animal was placed in a huge basket crate,
slung under a pole, and carried by natives over the rough
forest trails to the nearest river transportation.</p>
<p><b>The Tapirs.</b>&mdash;Near the end of the Order of Hoofed Animals,
(<i>Ungulata</i>), is found the Tapir Family, represented
in both the old world and the new, by about five species.
These very odd creatures inhabit the densest forests of the
tropics, where vegetation grows rankly, and few other large
hoofed animals can live. They are very fond of water, and
swim well.</p>
<p><b>The South American Tapir</b>, (<i>Tapirus terrestris</i>), takes
kindly to captivity, breeds in confinement, and always manages
to look well-fed and as sleek as a seal. Its color is a
rich mahogany brown, and its long, prehensile nose is
strongly suggestive of the end of an elephant&rsquo;s trunk. The
shoulder height of a full-grown animal is about 37 inches.
This species inhabits Venezuela, the Guianas, Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay and some other regions of South America.
Some of the Central American Tapirs inhabit mountain regions,
but all are exceedingly wary, and difficult to find
without dogs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p><b>The Malay Tapir</b>, (<i>Tapirus indicus</i>), of the Malay Peninsula
and Sumatra, may be recognized as far as it can be seen,
by its colors. The front half of the animal, and its legs,
are black or dark brown, and the rear half of the body is
white. It is much larger than the preceding species.</p>
<h3 id="c23">THE WOLF DENS, No. 22.</h3>
<p>At the northeastern corner of the Elk Range there is a
huge, bare granite rock, two hundred feet long, shaped precisely
like the hump of a bull buffalo. The high end of the
hump is toward the north, and its crest is about fifteen feet
above the ground on its eastern side. A fringe of small
trees and bushes grows along its western side. On the east
side, well sheltered by the rock itself from the cold west
winds of winter, and also shaded by several fine trees which
most opportunely grow close beside the ledge, the Wolf
Dens and Fox Dens are situated.</p>
<p>In regard to the iron work, these dens are merely an
understudy of the Bear Dens. The dimensions of each den
of the series are 16 by 48 feet, and the height of the bars to
the top of the overhang is 9 feet 6 inches. The sleeping
dens are of simple construction, all save one being of wood,
trimmed with bark-covered slabs. At present the Wolf
Dens are divided into four compartments.</p>
<p><b>The Gray Wolf</b>, (<i>Canis nubilis</i>), is known by as many
names as it has color phases. In the North, where it is
white, it is called the &ldquo;White Wolf,&rdquo; while in Florida it
becomes the &ldquo;Black Wolf.&rdquo; In British Columbia and
around Great Slave Lake, both white and black wolves
abound, as well as the standard gray, but on the Barren
Grounds the white phase predominates. In Texas a &ldquo;Red
Wolf&rdquo; is found, but apparently the red phase is of somewhat
rare occurrence, and is never found in the North.</p>
<p>In the West this animal has recently come into prominence
in a way that is striking terror to the hearts of
ranchmen and others who have stock to lose. While all
kinds of desirable game animals are decreasing at an alarming
rate, the Gray Wolf not only holds its own, but is
multiplying rapidly. The destruction by it of calves, colts
and sheep, has become so great that nearly every western
State has placed on the head of this bold marauder a
bounty varying from $2 to $10. In some States this law
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
has been in force for several years, but with no sensible
diminution in the number of wolves.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/pmg066.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388" />
<p class="pcap">TIMBER WOLF.</p>
</div>
<p>The Gray Wolves which live in touch with civilization
are by no means such bold and dangerous animals as they
formerly were. In the early days, when wolves were
numerous and fire-arms few and primitive, the Gray Wolf
undoubtedly was a dangerous animal. But the breech-loading
rifle has changed all this. Excepting for his stock-killing
propensities, the Gray Wolf is now a skulking creature.
In the United States this animal possesses the courage
of a coyote, but in the Barren Grounds it is still fierce
and dangerous. However much the wolf may skulk and
flee when the way is open, when brought to bay he knows
how to fight. One snap of his powerful jaws and shear-like
teeth is enough to disable almost any dog, and send it
howling to the rear. It is no wonder that western dogs
of experience are shy of approaching a Gray Wolf within
snapping distance.</p>
<p>Excepting the localities from which it has been driven
out by civilization, the Gray Wolf ranges over the whole
North American continent from central Mexico to 83&deg; 24&prime; N.</p>
<p><b>The Coyote, or Prairie Wolf</b>, (<i>Canis latrans</i>), is a personal
acquaintance of nearly every trans-continental traveler.
To those who have camped on the &ldquo;plains,&rdquo; he is quite like
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
an old friend; and the high-pitched, staccato cry&mdash;half
howl and half bark&mdash;with which he announces the dawn,
is associated with memories of vast stretches of open country,
magnificent distances, sage-brush and freedom. Because
of his fondness of barking, Thomas Say, the naturalist
who first described this species, christened it, <i>Canis
latrans</i>, which means &ldquo;barking wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/pmg067.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="388" />
<p class="pcap">COYOTE: PRAIRIE WOLF.</p>
</div>
<p>This animal averages about one-third smaller than the
gray wolf, and while the finest male specimens are, in the
autumn, really handsome animals, at other times the majority
are of very ordinary appearance. At no time, however,
even in the dark, is a Coyote a courageous animal. So far
as man is concerned, a band of a thousand coyotes would
be as easily put to flight as one; but in hanging upon the
ragged edges of civilization, and living by its wits, the
Coyote is audacity itself. By inheritance, and also by personal
experience, this animal knows to a rod how far it
is safe to trust a man with a gun. If the hunter has left
his gun behind him, the Coyote knows it at once, and
boldly flaunts himself within stone&rsquo;s throw of his enemy.</p>
<p>The Coyote varies in color quite markedly, exhibiting the
gray, brown and black phases. Formerly it was supposed
that one species comprehended all, but Dr. Merriam&rsquo;s series
of specimens from all parts of the West and Southwest
have led him to separate these animals into eleven species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h3 id="c24">THE FOX DENS, No. 23.</h3>
<p>Of the many species of foxes found in North America,
three species stand forth as the types of prominent groups,
and it is very desirable that all three should be well known.</p>
<p><b>The Red Fox</b>, (<i>Vulpes fulvus</i>), is the representative of the
group which contains also the cross fox and black fox of
the Northwest. In spite of dogs, traps, guns, spades and
poison, this cunning creature persists in living in close
touch with the poultry yards of civilized man. His perfect
familiarity with old-fashioned dangers enables him to
avoid them all, and no sooner does a new danger menace
him than he promptly invents a way to escape it. The
manner in which the Red Fox lives with civilization without
being exterminated really is surprising, and speaks
volumes for the astuteness of this animal.</p>
<p>The geographical range of the Red Fox is very wide,
From North Carolina and Tennessee it extends northward
through the whole northeastern United States, gradually
bearing westward to Montana, and northward almost to
the Arctic Ocean. It is the commonest species in Alaska,
where it is found practically everywhere.</p>
<p>The typical Red Fox and its two subspecies, the <b>Cross Fox</b>,
(<i>Vulpes fulvus decussatus</i>), and the <b>Black Fox</b>, (<i>V. f. argentatus</i>)&mdash;the
latter many times miscalled the &ldquo;<b>Silver Fox</b>&rdquo;&mdash;vary
in all possible gradations of color from bright red to
pure black. Often it is difficult to decide where one type
leaves off and another begins. The Cross Fox stands midway
between the Red and Black, with some of the yellow
color of the former on the sides of the neck and behind
the foreleg, while the remainder of the general color is
grizzled gray-brown laid across his shoulders in a more or
less distinct cross. The Black Fox varies in color from
very dark iron-gray to dark brown or black, with a slight
wash of white-tipped hairs over the head, body and tail.
The tip of the tail is always white, which is the only constant
color mark about him.</p>
<p><b>The Swift, or Kit Fox</b>, (<i>Vulpes velox</i>), is the daintiest,
smallest and liveliest of all American foxes. From his
delicate little nose to the tip of his well-trimmed tail, he
is every inch a thoroughbred. His countenance is bright
and pert, and when several specimens are kept together
they are very playful. One striking feature of this little
animal is what may well be termed its trimness. When in
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
fair condition, its coat of thick, silvery gray fur is as smooth
and even as if recently trimmed by a barber.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">
<img src="images/pmg068.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="390" />
<p class="pcap">SWIFT OR KIT FOX.</p>
</div>
<p>On the western plains, where it once had for companions
the buffalo and prong-horn, the Swift is becoming rare. Its
worst enemy is the deadly strychnine bottle of the ranchman.
This species does not thrive in the Fox Dens, and it
will be found in the Burrowing Animal&rsquo;s Quarters, where it
seems pleased to consider itself at home.</p>
<p>In the Small-Mammal House is shown a new species,
closely allied to the above, from Phoenix, Arizona, recently
described by Dr. C. H. Merriam as <i>Vulpes macrotis</i>, or the
<b>Large-Eared Swift</b>.</p>
<p><b>The Gray Fox</b>, (<i>Urocyon virginianus</i>), is the fox of the
South, even though it does range northward well into the
territory of the red fox. This species is distinctly smaller
and more lightly built than the red, its hair is not so luxuriant,
it is more shy and retiring, and its colors change very
little. When hotly pursued by dogs it often climbs trees
that are quite perpendicular, to a height of twenty feet or
more. In captivity Gray Foxes are forever trying to escape
by climbing, instead of by burrowing, as would naturally
be expected. In temper, they are treacherous to their
keepers, and also to each other, and as &ldquo;pets&rdquo; are anything
but desirable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<div class="img" id="fig62">
<img src="images/pmg069.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="386" />
<p class="pcap">RED FOX.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Tasmanian Wolf, or Thylacine</b>, (<i>Thylacinus cynocephalus</i>),
is a very strange-looking and interesting creature,
about the size of a pointer dog. Its color is dark yellowish
brown, and it has a series of broad black stripes, or bands,
running across its hind quarters and loins. The wide gape
of its mouth reminds one of an iguana or a monitor.</p>
<p>This animal, fully named above, is the largest of the carnivorous
marsupials of Australia, and the female possesses
an abdominal pouch in which she carries her young, like
a kangaroo. It is now found only in Tasmania, and it dwells
amongst rocks, in rugged and mountainous regions. Because
of its depredations upon the sheep herds, the Thylacine
has been diligently hunted and destroyed, and now
living specimens rarely are taken.</p>
<p>In the zoological gardens of Europe and America, this
species usually is kept in heated buildings, but it has been
ascertained by experiment that this specimen thrives best
in the open air. Living examples in captivity are now so
very rare it is a difficult matter to keep one constantly on
exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="c25">THE OTTER POOLS, No. 31.</h3>
<p><b>The American Otter</b>, (<i>Lutra canadensis</i>), is unfortunate
in being the bearer of valuable fur; and in the northern
regions, where the cold causes the development of fur that
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
is available for the use of the furrier, this creature is so
nearly extinct that trappers no longer pursue it. In the
southern States, where its fur is short, rather coarse and
&ldquo;off color,&rdquo; the Otter still is found. In some portions of
eastern Florida, and along the coast of South Carolina, it
is frequently taken. In captivity, it often becomes quite
tame, even affectionate, and always is interesting. Unless
closely confined, however, it is prone to wander, and meet
premature death.</p>
<p>In captivity the Otter usually is active and restless, and
very much in evidence. Owing to the strength of its jaws,
its ability to climb under certain conditions and its restless
activity, it is difficult to confine a full-grown Otter in anything
else than a complete box of iron cage-work.</p>
<p>Few persons save woodsmen and naturalists are aware of
the fact that in a wild state the Otter is a very playful animal,
and is as fond of sliding down hill, over a wet and
muddy slide, with a water plunge at the bottom, as any
young person is of &ldquo;shooting the chutes.&rdquo; Like the small
boy with the sled and a snowy hillside, the Otter sometimes
indulges in its sliding pastime for an hour at a time, with
a keen relish for the sport that is quite evident to all who
have ever watched it.</p>
<p>The Otter is a carnivorous animal, and in a wild state
lives upon fish, frogs, crabs, young birds, small mammals,
and, in fact, about any living thing which it can catch.</p>
<p><b>The Coypu Rat</b>, (<i>Myopotamus coypu</i>), of Central and
South America, is interesting because of the fact that it is
the largest of all rats or rat-like animals. In its habits it
is as fond of water as the musk-rat. It is sufficiently clothed
with fur to endure outdoor life in the Park, even in winter,
and it has been acclimatized here in one of the other pools.
It breeds persistently, and thrives in captivity, provided it
is treated as it should be.</p>
<h3 id="c26">THE SMALL-MAMMAL HOUSE, No. 35.</h3>
<p>The new Small-Mammal House, erected and occupied in
1905, is a very different structure from the temporary building
which formerly occupied the site. The present building
is a twin of the Ostrich House, and in it much effort has
been expended in devising ways and means to keep its living
inhabitants clean, odorless and in good health. Owing,
however, to the musky odors secreted by many of the civet
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
cats and members of the Marten Family, it is beyond human
power to keep a large collection such as this building contains
without a certain amount of wild-animal odor.</p>
<p>Most difficult of all collections to settle satisfactorily in a
modern zoological park or garden is the great <i>omnium
gatherum</i> of small species&mdash;and some large ones, also&mdash;which
fall within the meaning of the term &ldquo;small mammals.&rdquo;
The number of mammalian miscellanea which can not have
buildings all their own is really very great. In addition to
that there are always with us a considerable number of
young and tender animals which require small quarters, and
close attention. The visitor will therefore always find in
the Small-Mammal House a great array of viverrine animals,
of tropical squirrels and other small rodents, of mustelines,
the nasuas, the small marsupials, young leopards, the
lynxes and their relatives, baby bears, and many other
species.</p>
<p>Attention is invited to the great variety of cages in and
around this building, of which there are five different types.
The total number is 176. All those on the western side are
adjustable as to their bottoms and sides, so that it is easy
to throw several cages into one, and make cages either
very long or very high. The idea of the collapsible cage,
and also the general plan of it, has been copied from the
model developed and in use in the Zoological Garden of
Frankfort, Germany, by Director A. Seitz, to whom this
acknowledgment is justly due. It will be noticed that
every animal in this building enjoys the use of an outdoor
cage, which connects directly with its interior quarters.</p>
<p>Of such an odd mixture of animals as we are now to consider,
anything like a perfect systematic zoological arrangement
is a practical impossibility; but as far as it is possible,
we will take up the animals by groups.</p>
<p>On the whole, the most striking animals in the Small-Mammal
House are the small cats and lynxes. Of the
spotted cats, the <b>Serval</b>, (<i>Felis serval</i>), of Africa, is one of
the rarest. Its long, slender legs, small head, slender body
and round spots proclaim it a near relative of the cheetah.</p>
<p><b>The Clouded Leopard</b>, (<i>Felis nebulosa</i>).&mdash;The dense and
humid jungles of Borneo contain a beautiful tree-climbing
leopard whose markings are laid on its sides in large, elliptical
patches of pleasing pattern. This is the Clouded
Leopard, so delicate in captivity that only one out of every
four or five becomes acclimatized outside its native jungles.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
Our fine adult specimen, with very long canine teeth suggestive
of those of the saber-toothed tiger, really belongs
in the Lion House, but we dare not move it, for fear the
change would in some manner prove fatal to it. It is an
animal of vicious temper, and makes friends with no one.
The half light of its cage is a welcome approach to the
dense shadows in which it lives when at home.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig63">
<img src="images/pmg070.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="382" />
<p class="pcap">OCELOT.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Jungle Cat</b>, (<i>F. bengalensis</i>), is a small and inconspicuous
type, as befits an animal which lives by stealth in
densely populated regions. The <b>Ocelot</b>, (<i>Felis pardalis</i>), of
South and Central America, is a small spotted cat which
very often is called a &ldquo;young jaguar.&rdquo; In size it is the
third largest <i>Felis</i> of the American continent; but for all
that, it is so small that an adult specimen would not make
more than one square meal for a hungry jaguar. It is
found from southern Texas to southern Brazil.</p>
<p>The little <b>Margay Cat</b>, (<i>F. tigrina</i>), is our smallest and
also rarest spotted cat. It is no larger than a good-sized
domestic cat, and its tawny ground-color is marked all over
with round spots. The rarest American feline in our possession
is the queer, otter-like <b>Yaguarundi Cat</b>, (<i>F. yaguarundi</i>),
of a uniform gray-brown color, without spots. It
is found in southern Texas and Mexico, and is so seldom
seen in captivity that comparatively few persons north of
the Rio Grande are aware of its existence. Our specimen
came from Brownsville, Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img" id="fig64">
<img src="images/pmg071.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="385" />
<p class="pcap">COMMON GENET.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Bay Lynx, Red Lynx, or Wild Cat</b>, (<i>Lynx rufus</i>), is
the smallest of American Lynxes, and it is the one that inhabits
the United States eastward of the great plains. Until
further notice, this species will be found in the Small-Mammal
House. It may have a few dark spots, or none at all.
Its color varies so greatly that it is at times impossible to
determine where this species leaves off, and the more heavily
spotted subspecies of the southwest takes its place. The
latter is known as the <b>Spotted Lynx</b>, (<i>L. r. maculatus</i>).</p>
<p>The large and important group of Viverrines, or long-faced
cat-like carnivores of the East Indies, (Family <i>Viverridae</i>),
is well represented. It is the true Civets which furnish&mdash;some
of them&mdash;the evil-smelling civet of commerce&mdash;an
odor which we would gladly do without. The <b>Common
Civet-Cat</b>, (<i>Viverra zibetha</i>), is the best known member of
this Family, and it is easily recognized by its large size,
heavily-spotted body and ring-streaked tail. It is common
throughout the Malay Peninsula, and in many other portions
of the Malay Archipelago. The larger <b>Malayan Civet-Cat</b>,
(<i>V. malaccensis</i>), strongly resembles its understudy, but its
black spots and blotches are larger and more intense, and in
form it is much more robust.</p>
<p>The large and handsome <b>White-Whiskered Paradoxure</b>,
(<i>Paradoxurus leucomystax</i>), has been in the Park about six
years, and to-day it coughs and snarls at the visitor just as
it did in the beginning. It is a smooth-coated creature,
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
colored like a puma, and comes from northern China. Other
members of the Family <i>Viverridae</i> contained in the collection
are the <b>Malayan Paradoxure</b>, (<i>P. hermaphroditus</i>); the <b>Black
Paradoxure</b>, (<i>P. niger</i>); the <b>African Ichneumon</b>, (<i>Herpestes
ichneumon</i>), the strange black creature from the Malay Peninsula
called the <b>Binturong, or &ldquo;Bear-Cat,&rdquo;</b> (<i>Arctictis binturong</i>),
and the <b>Suricate, or Slender-Tailed Meerkat</b>, (<i>Suricata
tetradactyla</i>), of South Africa.</p>
<p>Into the Small-Mammal House have drifted and comfortably
settled down several canine species which are not so
well satisfied, elsewhere. <b>The Black-Backed Jackal</b>, (<i>Canis
mesomelas</i>), of Africa, is one of the most interesting, and it
is also the one that thrives best in captivity. It is very
much like a dark phase of the Azara Dog, of South America,
and it is the handsomest of all the Jackals. <b>The Cape Hunting
Dog</b>, of eastern Africa, has for years been present in
this building, and it will be kept as continuously as circumstances
will permit.</p>
<p><b>The New Mexico Desert Fox</b>, (<i>Vulpes macrotis neomexicanus</i>), is
a small understudy of the better known <b>Swift</b> or
<b>Kit Fox</b> of the northern plains, but it has larger ears.
Neither of these delicate little species seems to thrive in our
large Fox Dens, which seem to be too large for them; but
in this building they thrive and are quite content with life.
The Swift Fox is the four-footed elf of the plains, and it
is unfortunate that the poison laid for the fierce and cruel
stock-killing wolves should prove its extermination&mdash;as it
surely will, ere long.</p>
<p><b>The Arctic Fox</b>, (<i>Vulpes lagopus</i>).&mdash;This creature of the
polar world is a striking example of climatic influence on
a species, and also of the danger that lies in describing a
species from a single specimen. In the far north, the
Arctic Fox is snow-white all the year round. Farther south
it is white in winter, but in summer is bluish-brown. In the
southern part of its range, the Aleutian Archipelago for
example, except for an occasional white individual, it is
dark all the year round, and is known only as the <b>Blue
Fox</b>. At first it may seem difficult to believe that these two
widely-different extremes are only color-phases of the same
species; but it is quite true. The dark-colored animal is
not even accorded subspecific rank.</p>
<p>On various islands along the Alaska coast, especially in
the Aleutian Archipelago, about forty commercial companies
are engaged in breeding Blue Foxes for their fur, some of
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
them with satisfactory success. The foxes are fed daily,
on cooked corn meal and dried fish. They come up to be
fed, and when the time comes to handle and sort them
previous to killing the annual allotment, they greatly facilitate
matters by the readiness with which they enter box
traps.</p>
<p>The great decrease in the annual supply of good fur
has caused many persons to hope that fox-breeding may
be developed into a remunerative industry. Except in
Alaska, no extensive experiments in that line have been
made. It is quite desirable that fox-breeding in the United
States should be taken up under state or national auspices,
and worked out to a successful issue. There is good reason
to hope and believe that it might be developed into an important
industry.</p>
<p>From Argentina, South America, have come two fine
specimens of the <b>Azara Dog</b>, (<i>Canis azarae</i>), which, but for
their half dog-like tails might pass anywhere as rather odd-looking
gray foxes. But they are a visible reminder of the
fact that the pampas of South America contain an extensive
series of foxes and wild dogs, which thus far is practically
unknown everywhere north of the Amazon.</p>
<p><b>The Dingo, or Australian Wild Dog</b>, (<i>Canis dingo</i>), is
represented by two specimens which look like ordinary
yellow dogs. By many persons it is believed that this animal
was not indigenous to Australia, and was planted there
by man, but the evidence in support of that supposition is
by no means conclusive.</p>
<p><b>The Coati-Mundi</b>, (pronounced coy-ty mon-day), is for
its size one of the best exhibition animals that can be found
outside of the Primate House. It is closely related to our
raccoon, but is far more showy and interesting. It has a
very lively and industrious disposition, is a good climber,
and from dawn until dark is almost constantly on the move.
Although it is a carnivorous animal, and provided with
powerful canine teeth, it is not naturally quarrelsome, but
on the contrary is quite gregarious in its habits. The genus
<i>Nasua</i> inhabits Mexico, Central and South America. We
have two species, the <b>Red Coati-Mondi</b>, (<i>Nasua rufa</i>), and
the <b>White-Nosed</b>, (<i>N. narica</i>).</p>
<p><b>The Raccoon Dog</b>, of Japan, (<i>Nyctereutes procyonoides</i>),
is to all outward appearances a raccoon, but its feet are
digitigrade, not plantigrade, and it is a true dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p><b>The American Badger</b>, (<i>Taxidea americana</i>), is represented
by a fine, large and very light-colored specimen that
was presented by President Roosevelt. The <b>European
Badger</b>, (<i>Meles taxus</i>), is shown near by.</p>

<p>No collection of Rodents is worthy of acceptance by the
public without a fair representation of Porcupines. The
most wonderful species is the <b>African Porcupine</b>, (<i>Hystrix
cristata</i>), which when disturbed erects a threatening array
of enormously-long, shining black-and-white quills that are
a wonder to behold. The lofty white crest of this animal
is one of its most conspicuous features.</p>
<p><b>The Indian Crestless Hill Porcupine</b>, (<i>H. longicauda</i>),
usually present in our collection, is merely a quiet understudy
of the former. Strange to say&mdash;and also provoking&mdash;our
old friend of the North Woods, the <b>Canada Porcupine</b>,
(<i>Erethizon dorsatus</i>), is much more capricious and
difficult to keep for a long period than either of the fine
foreign species already mentioned. It is only the men who
know all about animals who can tell us why nothing seems
to exactly satisfy them, and why they will not breed here,
live ten years and be happy. Even the best cage life does
not seem to be good enough for them; but we are still
experimenting.</p>
<p>In order that visitors to the Park may at all times be
able to see a <b>Beaver</b>, (<i>Castor canadensis</i>), and not be
thwarted in that desire by the very shy habits of the animals
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
in the Beaver Pond, we have a specimen on exhibition
in the Small-Mammal House. This individual came from
the Rio Grande, as a small kit, and has been reared in its
present quarters. It is kept constantly supplied with food--wood,
chiefly of poplar and maple, and clean water in which
to bathe.</p>

<p><b>The Capybara</b>, (<i>Hydrochaerus capybara</i>), is the largest of
all gnawing animals, and the most remarkable rodent in
our collection. In form and size it suggests a large, gray,
coarse-haired pig. It is a water-loving animal, of the American
tropics, and lives on the grassy banks of the delta of
the Orinoco, and similar places farther south. It is one of
the best divers of all land animals, and when attacked on
land always plunges into the water and dives for about
100 feet before coming to the surface. It is strictly a vegetable
feeder, and its flesh is very palatable food. It takes
kindly to captivity, and in disposition it is very affectionate.</p>
<p><b>The Agouti</b>, (<i>Dasyprocta</i>), is to the jungles of South
America as the cotton-tail rabbit is to the forests of the
eastern United States; but structurally it is not closely
related to the members of the Rabbit Family. It lives
wholly on the ground, in dense cover, and is very difficult
to shoot. As a rule, it is impossible for dogs to catch it
because it runs so swiftly through the dense cover that
they cannot keep it in sight. There are a number of species,
varying in color from dark brown to golden yellow.</p>

<p><b>The Toothless Mammals.</b>&mdash;The Order <i>Edentata</i> contains
some of the most odd and remarkable mammals that ever
find their way into a zoological park. They are the armadilloes,
ant-eaters and sloths. Without exception, they are
delicate feeders, and difficult to keep for long periods, and
for this reason the number on exhibition constantly varies
between half a score and none at all! As far as it is possible,
the species named below will be kept on exhibition;
but these rarities are difficult to obtain, and the supply
must be regarded as intermittent.</p>
<p><b>The Nine-Banded Armadillo</b>, (<i>Tatu novemcinctum</i>), of
southern Texas and Arizona, and southward, is the only
edentate found in the United States. Its total length, from
nose to tail-tip, is about 26 inches, and it is about as large
as an opossum. Its strangest feature is the horny shell,
with 9 jointed bands in the middle, which Nature has designed
for the animal&rsquo;s protection. It lives in burrows in
the earth, and in a wild state it feeds on a mixed diet of
worms, ants, snails, beetles, grasshoppers and other insects.</p>
<p><b>The Six-Banded Armadillo</b>, (<i>Dasypus sexcinctus</i>), of South
America, has a much stronger and more bony shell than the
preceding species, but very similar habits. <b>The Three-Banded
Armadillo</b>, (<i>Tolypeutes tricinctus</i>), is the most remarkable
of all&mdash;and also the most difficult to obtain. It
is able to convert itself into a round ball covered at all
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
points by bony armor, and remarkably well protected from
the teeth of predatory animals.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig67">
<img src="images/pmg074.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="396" />
<p class="pcap">GREAT ANT-EATER.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Great Ant-Eater</b>, (<i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>).&mdash;This is a
very remarkable animal, and usually is to be found alive in
the Small-Mammal House. Its anatomical peculiarities are
apparent at a glance. Its toothless jaws are enormously
elongated, and taper to a rounded point, where the mouth
opens as a narrow slit, scarcely large enough to admit the
large end of a lead pencil. Its front claws are large and
strong, for use in tearing open ant-hills and decayed logs;
and the creature walks upon them as if club-footed. Its
tail is long and thick, and bears a luxuriant brush, of coarse,
wavy hair more than a foot long. The negroes of British
Guiana gravely inform travellers that the Ant-Eater uses
his bushy tail as a broom, with which he sweeps up ants in
order to devour them wholesale.</p>
<p>As may be inferred from the total absence of teeth, this
strange creature lives chiefly upon crawling insects. In devouring
the dreadful ants, which in a South American forest
often make life a burden, it helps to preserve the balance
of Nature. In captivity the food of this animal consists of
milk, raw eggs and ground meat. In taking its food it
thrusts out from four to eight inches of round, wormlike
tongue, which contrary to many published statements, is
not covered with sticky saliva.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<div class="img" id="fig68">
<img src="images/pmg075.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="394" />
<p class="pcap">SIX-BANDED ARMADILLO.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Tamandua</b>, (<i>Tamandua tetradactyla</i>), is a smaller
ant-eater than the preceding species, of tree-climbing habits,
with a proportionately shorter head, no long hair on its
tail, and extremely large front claws. It is found in Venezuela,
the Guianas, Brazil, and in fact that greater portion
of the region of tropical forests on this continent south of
Mexico. Its tail is prehensile, or grasping, and in climbing
is used almost constantly.</p>
<p><b>The Sloths</b> are the slowest, the most helpless and defenseless
of the edentates. They subsist chiefly upon leaves,
they climb no more swiftly than a man, and they escape
their enemies through the resemblance of their pelage to the
rough bark of the tree-trunks among which they live. They
have a few teeth, but none for defense, and their claws
are of use only in climbing, except that they can pinch
with them.</p>
<p>Two species of Sloth are occasionally seen in the Zoological
Park, but usually <i>in the Primate House</i>, where the
high temperature is better suited to their needs.</p>
<p><b>The Three-Toed Sloth</b>, (<i>Bradypus tridactylus</i>), is the one
with a brown &ldquo;saddle-mark&rdquo; of short hair in the middle of
its back. The remainder of its pelage is coarse and long,
and its greenish tint renders it a close imitation of algae-covered
tree-bark. <b>The Two-Toed Sloth</b>, (<i>Choloepus hoffmani</i>),
is much larger than the preceding, and lives longer
in captivity. Four fine adult specimens occupy a large cage
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
at the Primate House, where they seem to be fully acclimatized.
In form and habit they are remarkable animals, and
well worthy of close attention.</p>

<p><b>The Egg-Laying Mammals.</b>&mdash;For several months there
were exhibited here two <b>Echidnas</b>&mdash;of all small mammals
ever seen alive in New York the most wonderful. The Echidna
comes from Australia, the home of remarkable types of
animals, and belongs to the lowest Order of Mammals,
(<i>Monotremata</i>). Like its distant relative, the duck-billed
platypus, it reproduces by <i>laying eggs</i>! Its back
is covered with short but very thick spines, and its nose is
a long, slender beak, absolutely unique. Other examples
of this species will be exhibited whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="c27">THE PUMA AND LYNX HOUSE, No. 33A.</h3>
<p>Near the Small-Mammal House (No. 35) will be found
a log cabin with its entire front opening into two wire-covered
yards. The interior of the building is provided
with sleeping-dens in which the occupants of the two enclosures
can keep dry and warm. This installation is for
lynxes, but half of it is occupied by pumas. Already it has
fully proven the desirability of keeping lynxes and pumas
constantly in the open air, and without artificial heat. To
lynxes especially there is nothing more deadly than a well-heated
room, indoors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p><b>The Puma</b>, (<i>Felis concolor</i>), is described in the section
relating to the Lion House, where other Pumas are exhibited
(<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>).</p>
<p>Of the Lynxes, we have two well-defined species, and
one subspecies. The <b>Canada Lynx</b>, (<i>Lynx canadensis</i>), is
well represented in the southern compartment of the Puma
House, where a fine adult pair has become acclimatized.
This is the <i>Loup Cervier</i> of the French Canadians, and it is
truly the Lynx of Canada and the subarctic North. It has
<i>no spots on its body</i>, and its pelage is a cold pepper-and-salt
gray color. Its feet are large and heavily furred, and
it has a long, black hair-pencil on the tip of each ear. A
large specimen stands 18 inches high, and weighs 22 pounds.
The food of the American Lynxes generally consists of hares
and rabbits, ground birds of all kinds, and anything else
that can be caught and killed, except porcupine. To man
they are not &ldquo;dangerous animals.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c28">THE BURROWING MAMMALS, AND OTHERS, No. 42.</h3>
<p>North America is wonderfully rich in species of gnawing
animals, and the end is not yet. The investigations of our
mammalogists are adding new species with a degree of
rapidity and parallelism that is fairly bewildering.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the Zoological Society to do its utmost
to increase as much as possible the sum total of knowledge
of our largest Order of Mammals. Manifestly, however, it
is impracticable to do more than place before visitors a reasonable
number of well-chosen types, which shall represent
as many as possible of the twelve Families, and also the
genera most worth knowing.</p>
<p>The most serious obstacle in the way of anyone who attempts
to exhibit collections of living rodents lies in the
natural propensity of so many species to keep out of sight
during the daytime. This is particularly true of the members
of the Mouse, Pocket Gopher, and Pouched Rat Families,
comprising about three hundred species in all. With
very few exceptions, the whole matter of the exhibition
of collections of living rodents is something new, and every
step is an experiment. In the belief that even the most shy
burrowing animals will appreciate abundant room, perfectly
natural surroundings, plenty of food, and immunity from
annoyance, and eventually fall into the habit of spending
many of the daylight hours above ground, as do prairie-dogs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
the Society has constructed a series of fifteen small
yards, each 10&times;20 feet, bounded by walls going down to
bedrock, and enclosed above by a box-like arrangement of
very light wire-netting 5 feet high. The ground is chiefly
undisturbed soil of a firm and gravelly nature, thoroughly
drained, and all earth filling has been tightly rammed into
place to prevent caving in the burrows. Above ground,
each yard contains weathered rocks, stumps, and hollow
logs in abundance.</p>
<p>In these fifteen yards, each of which will hold specimens
of at least two or three species, will be placed strongly
marked types of those families whose representatives are
most numerous in North America, and also the least known,
only a few of which may be mentioned here.</p>
<p><b>The Sewellel Family</b>, (<i>Aplodontidae</i>), contains five or six
species and is of unusual scientific interest. The Sewellel,
Mountain Beaver, Farmer or &ldquo;Showt&rsquo;l&rdquo; (<i>Aplodontia rufus</i>
and <i>major</i>), is an animal of the size and general appearance
of a large, short-tailed muskrat. It inhabits a few localities
in remote regions in the mountain-valleys of northern California,
Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia.
It feeds like a beaver, climbs bushes four feet high, burrows
in <i>wet</i> ground, and fights like a little fiend when brought to
bay. Notwithstanding the size of this animal, it is very
seldom seen, and is but little known.</p>
<p><b>The Squirrel Family</b>, (<i>Sciuridae</i>), is large (one hundred
and forty-one species), very interesting, and entitled to
much consideration. In the present enclosure will be shown
in summer many species of interesting ground squirrels,
chipmunks, and marmots. In winter all the squirrels, save
one or two hardy native species, will be found in the Small-Mammal
House, near by.</p>
<p><b>The Rabbit Family</b>, (<i>Leporidae</i>), is one of the most difficult
to install and exhibit. Its members are large and
showy, but for several reasons it is very difficult to keep
them on exhibition in captivity. In time, however, all four
of the great groups&mdash;<b>Rabbit</b>, <b>Varying Hare</b>, <b>Jack Hare</b>, and
also the <b>Pikas</b>, forming the allied Family <i>Ochotonidae</i>&mdash;will
be represented by specimens.</p>
<p>Just what can be accomplished satisfactorily with the
most interesting members of the <b>Jumping Mouse</b>, <b>Pouched
Rat</b>, and <b>Pocket Gopher</b> Families, remains to be determined
by trial. If they can be induced to show themselves to
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
visitors, during daylight hours, they will be kept for exhibition;
otherwise not. At present, some examples of these
species can be seen in the Reptile House.</p>
<p><b>In Winter.</b>&mdash;In the temperate zone, when &ldquo;winter comes
to rule the varied year,&rdquo; all the burrowing animals must
retire to their burrows, live upon their buried stores of
winter food, and hibernate until spring. The tropical
species do not know how to hibernate, and therefore they
must be taken indoors, or they perish.</p>
<p>In order that our native species of rodents may be seen
all winter, and that the tropical species may be kept alive,
nearly all the animals that in summer live in the Burrowing
Mammal Quarters are removed in autumn to the well-warmed
Small-Mammal House. It also happens that in
summer a few of the small carnivores, and all armadilloes,
are kept in these Quarters.</p>
<p>In addition to the rodents which it is practicable to exhibit
in these enclosures, the summer season will find some
of them occupied by certain especially interesting species
which need the soil of Mother Earth as well as sunlight
and air. Here will be found the <b>Armadilloes</b>, the <b>Nasuas</b>,
the <b>Raccoon Dogs</b>, the <b>Swift Foxes</b> and a few others, which
in winter belong in the Small-Mammal House.</p>
<h3 id="c29">THE PRAIRIE-DOG VILLAGE, No. 41.</h3>
<p><b>The Western Prairie-&ldquo;Dog,&rdquo;</b> or <b>Prairie Marmot</b>, (<i>Cynomys
ludovicianus</i>).&mdash;Occupying a conspicuous hill-top near
the Small-Deer House, and overlooking the Wild-Fowl
Pond, is a circular enclosure, 80 feet in diameter, surrounded
by an iron fence with an overhang, with walls
going down to bedrock. This contains about fifty fat and
jolly little Prairie Marmots, one-half of which are the gift
of a Montana ranchman, Mr. Howard Eaton. The soil of
the enclosure has never been disturbed, and there is no
danger that the little creatures ever will be smothered in
their burrows, as frequently happens in earth that has once
been dug up and filled in again.</p>
<p>Owing to its optimistic and even joyous disposition, the
Prairie-&ldquo;Dog&rdquo; has many friends, and &ldquo;happy as a Prairie-'Dog&rsquo;&rdquo;
would be a far better comparison than &ldquo;happy as a
king.&rdquo; His cousin, the woodchuck, has the air of being
perpetually &ldquo;in the dumps,&rdquo; but the Prairie-&ldquo;Dog&rdquo;&mdash;never.
His so-called bark is really a laugh, and his absurd little tail
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
was given to him solely as a means of visible expression of
good nature. But he has his enemies and detractors. The
coyote loves his plump and toothsome body; the &ldquo;granger&rdquo;
hates him for the multitude of his holes, and puts spoonfuls
of poisoned wheat into his burrow.</p>
<h3 id="c30">THE BEAR DENS, No. 37.</h3>
<p>The bears of the world form a very interesting group;
and when its representatives are properly installed&mdash;in
large, open yards, with abundant sunlight, fresh air and
room for exercise&mdash;they develop finely, live happily, and
furnish endless entertainment. Under proper conditions,
bears are cheerful animals, full of the playful spirit that
robs captivity of its chief terror. To confine large bears
singly, in small cages, or in wet-floored, high-walled dungeons,
or in the unspeakable &ldquo;pits&rdquo; of mediaeval type, is a
sin against Nature. It is to be noted, however, that small
and timid bears, like <i>Ursus japonicus</i>, are better off in small
cages than in the very large ones; and it is for this reason
that eight small dens have been provided, opposite the original
series.</p>
<p>The Zoological Society has put forth considerable effort
in constructing a series of nine large Bear Dens which provide
ideal conditions for their inmates. Bears do not need
<i>buildings</i>! Their habits call for large, open yards, properly
situated, with snug and dry sleeping-dens attached, to
which they can retire whenever they wish. To them,
masonry walls are worse than useless, for they cut off sunlight
and promote dampness; but rocks and trees upon
which to climb are very beneficial. In warm weather, all
bears are fond of bathing, and a bathing pool in each cage
is very necessary.</p>
<p><i>It is cruelty to animals</i> for visitors to throw peanuts, or
food of any kind, into our bear dens; and it is <i>strictly forbidden</i>.
All persons who do not wish to be reprimanded in
public, or arrested, are advised to refrain from it. Teasing
with food always irritates bears, sets them to fighting, spoils
their dispositions and <i>renders them dangerous to the keepers
who have to go in with them</i>! <i>All visitors who are law-abiding,
and friendly to the Zoological Society, are requested
to assist the keepers and policemen in preventing lawless persons
from throwing food into the bear dens.</i> A stern reprimand
often prevents serious trouble.</p>

<p><b>The Polar Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>).&mdash;In nearly every collection
of living bears the individuals of this species are the
most showy and attractive. Their white coats quickly catch
the eye of the visitor, and whether young or old, they are
generally the most active and playful of all captive bears.
In cold weather, when other bears lie in the sun, or, if permitted,
curl up in the straw of their sleeping dens, the
Polar Bear will disport himself in the freezing cold water
of his swimming pool, and joyously play with a cake of ice
until the sight of it makes one shiver.</p>
<p>The Polar Bear Den is situated at the north end of Rocking-Stone
Hill, about two hundred feet from the north end
of the main series of Bear Dens. It is reached by descending
the steps leading toward the Beaver Pond, and turning to
the right. From the Rocking-Stone Restaurant, the Polar
Bears are quickly reached by descending the hill toward the
north.</p>
<p>Although the Polar Bear inhabits practically the whole of
the Arctic Ocean and its numerous islands, it is by no means
the most northerly warm-blooded mammal. Nansen found
fox tracks at 85&deg; N., but the most northerly bear observed
was on the 84th parallel. The favorite home of this animal
is the edge of the great polar ice cap, where Neptune
and the &ldquo;Frost King&rdquo; wage continuous warfare. He seldom
ventures more than a day&rsquo;s journey inland, on any shore.
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
In winter, as the edge of the ice-pack moves southward, and
in summer when it retreats northward, he follows it in
order to keep in touch with the ringed seals and walrus
that also go with it.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig71">
<img src="images/pmg078.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="403" />
<p class="pcap">POLAR BEAR &ldquo;SILVER KING.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The power of the Polar Bear to resist ice-cold water&mdash;nay,
even to enjoy it&mdash;may fairly be regarded as one of
the wonders of Nature. On the coast of Alaska this strange
creature will plunge into the Arctic Ocean and swim miles
from shore, through tossing fields of broken ice, and wherever
the mother leads, her cubs follow.</p>
<p>In the Autumn of 1910, the sealing steamer &ldquo;<i>Boethic</i>&rdquo; arrived
at New York bringing two adult Polar Bears that were
captured in the summer of that year by Mr. Paul J. Rainey.
Both animals were presented to the Zoological Society, and
the largest one called &ldquo;Silver King&rdquo; occupies the cage
that was specially built for the polar bears, and the female
is exhibited in very comfortable quarters, built for her near
that installation. Owing to their savage temper neither
of these bears ever can be kept with other bears, nor can
any keeper ever enter the cage of either. &ldquo;Silver King&rdquo;
weighs 880 pounds and is probably the largest Polar Bear
ever captured alive and unhurt. While the female is not as
large as &ldquo;Silver King,&rdquo; she is in every way as perfect a
specimen.</p>
<p><b>The Yakutat Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus dalli</i>).&mdash;In 1899, we received
from Hudson Lake, Copper River District, Alaska, two

young Alaskan Brown Bears which for some time we believed
would prove to represent the species found on Kadiak
Island. In this belief they were for a time labeled as Kadiak
Bears, (<i>U. middendorffi</i>), and so entered provisionally
in previous editions of the Guide Book. The maturity of
the animals has proven that this supposition was erroneous.
The extremely short and thick muzzle of the adult male
proves conclusively that they are not identical with the
long-skulled species of Kadiak. This interesting pair, absolutely
identical in color with <i>middendorffi</i>, are now identified,
pending further revisions of our <i>Urisdae</i>, as <i>Ursus
dalli</i>.</p>

<p>This species, and the two following, well represent the
group of big Alaskan Brown Bears, which are quite distinct
from the grizzlies and blacks. They are characterized by
their great size, high shoulders, massive heads, shaggy brown
pelage, and large claws. They live chiefly upon salmon,
which they catch from the small streams, but they also
devour great quantities of <i>grass</i>.</p>
<p><b>The Peninsula Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus gyas</i>), of Moeller Bay, well
down the Alaskan Peninsula, may at once be recognized
by its light brownish-yellow color, and its great size for a
bear born in 1904. Its claws are of enormous thickness.</p>
<p>This animal is now beyond doubt one of the two largest
bears in captivity, his only rival being in the Zoological Park
at Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p><b>The Admiralty Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus eulophus</i>), represents a large
species originally discovered on Admiralty Island, southern
Alaska. Its dark brown color is very much like that of the
Yakutat and Kadiak bears.</p>
<p><b>The Grizzly Bear</b>, or &ldquo;<b>Silver-Tip Grizzly</b>,&rdquo;
(<i>Ursus horribilis</i>).&mdash;The
rapid disappearance of this species from the
United States renders all living examples of it specially
interesting.</p>
<p>Of all bears, the Silver-Tip Grizzly is the most savage and
dangerous. He is easily angered, and when wounded or
harried not only becomes furiously vindictive, but he also
possesses a degree of courage which renders him a dangerous
antagonist. As a general thing, a Grizzly Bear, like a
lion or tiger, will run as soon as he discovers the presence of
his only enemy&mdash;man; but if he is wounded or cornered&mdash;or
<i>thinks</i> he is cornered&mdash;he assumes the aggressive, without
an instant&rsquo;s delay. Unfortunately, the largest Silver-Tip
Grizzlies ever killed have been too far from scales to make
it possible to weigh them.</p>
<p>The most interesting specimen of the Rocky Mountain
Silver-Tip now on exhibition is a dark-colored and very
handsome specimen, named &ldquo;Engineer,&rdquo; obtained in
Meeker, Colorado, by Professor Henry F. Osborn, and presented
to the Society by the Engineers&rsquo; Club of New York
City. The color of this individual is darker than the most
common type of the Silver-Tip, which is sometimes almost
as gray as a badger.</p>
<p>A very beautiful male Silver-Tip, from Wyoming, is much
lighter in color than the Colorado specimen. Its face and
head are so light-colored it would be called by Rocky
Mountain hunters a &ldquo;Bald-Faced&rdquo; Grizzly. A third specimen
was obtained for the Society at White Horse, Yukon
Territory, in 1905, and its development will be watched with
much interest. Throughout the Rocky Mountain region
the &ldquo;Silver-Tip&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Grizzly&rdquo; are identical; but the
color of the species varies considerably.</p>
<p>In a wild state Grizzly Bears live on berries and fruits of
all kinds available, succulent roots, grubs, carrion if it comes
handy, and live game if it can be killed. In the cattle-growing
states bordering the Rocky Mountains, owing to
their cattle-killing propensities, a bounty of from twelve to
fifteen dollars per head is paid for their destruction.</p>
<p><b>The Black Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus americanus</i>).&mdash;Until quite recently
all black bears in North America were referred to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
single species, with the type of which most persons are
familiar. Even during the last twenty years living representatives
of the Black Bear group have been found in nearly
every state and territory of the United States, and also
in northern Mexico, Labrador, Province of Quebec, Alberta,
Assiniboia, British Columbia, Alaska, and the Mackenzie
River basin. Our collection contains Black Bears representing
several widely separated localities.</p>
<p><b>The Spectacled Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus ornatus</i>).&mdash;After ten years of
constant effort the Zoological Park finally acquired late in
1910, a fine male specimen of the very rare and little known
Spectacled Bear of the Andes of Ecuador and Peru.
This zoological prize was procured for us in Quito, by Mr.
Edgar Beecher Bronson (Author of &ldquo;In Closed Territory,&rdquo;)
and by him presented to the Society. &ldquo;Frederico&rdquo; is distinguished
by a glossy jet-black coat, very small ears, long
feet and a large imperfect circle of white around each eye,
with white bands down the cheeks and throat. In size it
matches a small American black bear. As soon as the new
bear dens are finished, this animal will be removed from the
Small-Mammal House to one of them. If this species was
ever before exhibited in North America, we have never
heard of it.</p>
<p><b>The Andean Black Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus ornatus thomasi</i>), from
Southern Columbia, South America, is a subspecies of the
spectacled bear, with no &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; around its eyes, and no
white markings save under its chin and throat. This specimen
is smaller than the one from Quito. Practically nothing
is known of the habits of these two species.</p>
<p><b>The Brown Bear</b> of Europe, (<i>Ursus arctos</i>), is represented
by two specimens from Central Russia which bear a general
resemblance to Rocky Mountain grizzlies. This is so striking
that were they not labeled very few persons would suspect
their European birth. They have the high shoulders and
grizzly brown coat of the silver-tip, and in the Rocky
Mountains would be considered good examples of <i>Ursus
horribilis</i>.</p>
<p>This pair has bred four times and reared some very fine
cubs.</p>
<p><b>The Syrian Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus syriacus</i>), is well represented by
a fine specimen from Trebizond, Asia Minor. This bear is
of a pale yellow color, with very high shoulders, narrow
head and smooth pelage. The Syrian bear represents &ldquo;the
bears of the Bible,&rdquo; which appeared in punishment of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
children who were disrespectful to the prophet Elisha.
Bears of this species are often trained to dance, and perform
various tricks at command, and usually lead very
miserable lives at the hands of gypsies and other bear
specialists of nomadic habits.</p>

<p class="pcap">SPECTACLED BEAR.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Hairy-Eared Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus piscator</i>), a species very
rarely seen in captivity, is represented by two fine specimens
from the Altai Mountains, Central Asia. This animal
is sometimes called, on account of its peculiar light brown
color, the <b>Isabella Bear</b>. Its more correct name has been
bestowed on account of its large and very hairy ears. It
inhabits northeastern Asia, as far southwestward as the
Altai Mountains. The fine pair exhibited were presented
to the Society by Mr. Carl Hagenbeck.</p>
<p><b>The Himalayan Black Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus torquatus</i>), is the
handsomest of the four living species of black bears, and
can easily be identified anywhere by three distinct characters,
neither of which is possessed by any other black bear.
They are, a <i>pure white chin</i>, <i>long side-whiskers on the jaws
and sides of the neck</i> and <i>very large ears</i>. Up to this date
the geographic range of this very interesting animal has
been recorded as extending from eastern Persia through
Beluchistan, Afghanistan, Assam, and South China to Formosa;
but the three specimens exhibited were taken in
northern Japan, where the existence of this species seems to
be established beyond question.</p>

</div>
<p><b>The Japanese Black Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus japonicus</i>), from northern
Japan, is one of the smallest of living bears, being only
slightly larger than the Malay sun bear. In general appearance
it suggests a small edition of the American black
bear. The first specimen exhibited at the Zoological Park
was very good-natured, but all these received since are
nervous and irritable, and also very timid.</p>
<p><b>The Sloth Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus labiatus</i>), often called the <b>Long-Lipped
Bear</b>, can be recognized as far as it can be seen by its
shaggy mop of enormously long, black hair, its white muzzle,
and its very long, white claws. It is a creature of many
peculiarities. It inhabits India generally in forest regions.
This is Kipling&rsquo;s &ldquo;Baloo.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>The Malay Sun Bear</b>, (<i>Ursus malayanus</i>), is the smallest
bear in the world, also the ugliest and the most ill-tempered.
When fully enraged, it sometimes barks like a dog. Its hair
is very short and close, and its head and feet seem to be too
large for its body. This species inhabits Borneo, Sumatra,
the Malay Peninsula and Farther India. Two specimens will
be found <i>in the Small-Mammal House</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c31">THE RACCOON TREE.</h3>
<p><b>The Raccoon Tree.</b>&mdash;A permanent installation for Raccoons
has been established near the southern end of the
Bear Dens, where its inmates will be near their plantigrade
relatives. At the foot of the steps leading down from the
Rocking Stone, a cedar-tree, forty feet in height, has been
enclosed by an elliptical iron fence provided with a sheet-metal
overhang which is not negotiable by any <i>Procyon</i>.
Inside the fence is a dry yard, a pool of water for all
purposes, and the trunk of the tree is surrounded by a
rustic shelter house, divided into ten warm and dry compartments.
Underneath the house is a clean and smooth
wooden floor, on which the food is served.</p>
<p>The smooth, horizontal limbs of a cedar-tree are grateful
and comforting to a dozing Raccoon, and the tree is not so
high that the animals can climb beyond the visual power of
the visitor.</p>
<h3 id="c32">THE BEAVER POND, No. 29.</h3>
<p>Hidden away in the deep valley between high hills of
virgin forest lies the Beaver Pond. The spot is so secluded,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
so silent and primeval, that it seems like the heart of the
Adirondack wilderness. Lying fairly in the lap of the
granite hills is a three-acre oval of level swamp, which
recently was full of woodland rubbish and choked by rank
weeds. The seclusion of the spot, the splendid forest, the
food-wood and the possibilities of the dam, all naturally
suggested the beaver.</p>
<p>In order that the building of a dam by the beavers would
not raise the water level so high as to flood the roots of a
number of fine forest trees and destroy them, two feet of
soil was taken out of the swamp, and at the same time a
broad outlet was excavated. A fence of small iron bars,
with an overhang, was designed to encircle an area of about
three acres. Within the enclosure thus made, stand several
large forest trees&mdash;chiefly oak, sweet gum, and maple&mdash;which
have been protected by guards of wire and corrugated
iron. The small maples, however, have been given
over to the beavers, to cut down and use as food-wood and
also in their dam-building operations.</p>
<p><b>The Beaver Colony</b> in our pond is in good working order,
and its display of work makes a highly satisfactory exhibit.
The dam, about 40 feet long and 4 feet high, was built of
poles and sticks which were cut, peeled, floated down and
placed by the beavers, and pointed up with mud. There is
a house 10 feet in diameter and 4 feet high, similarly constructed.
Within the enclosure about twenty saplings and
trees have been cut down by the beavers and used up for
food and building materials.</p>
<p>For this colony the Society is indebted to Mr. Hugh J.
Chisholm, who procured for it two specimens from Canada
and three from Maine.</p>
<p><b>The American Beaver</b>, (<i>Castor canadensis</i>), is a remarkable
animal. In original thought it is equalled by few animals,
and in industry by none. With the possible exception
of the porcupine, it is the largest gnawing animal in North
America, once was widely distributed, and its beautiful fur
has been in demand ever since the days of the colonists.
Unfortunately, the Beaver&rsquo;s intelligence was directed chiefly
to the building of dams, canals, and houses, and procuring
an abundant supply of food-wood, rather than in providing
itself with means of escape from its arch enemy&mdash;the man
with a steel trap. Because of the constant demand for its
fur, this animal has been so nearly exterminated throughout
the United States that practically none remains save where
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
they are rigidly protected. At present the largest colonies
known are those in the Yellowstone Park, although in Canada
and the Northwest many still remain.</p>
<p>The most wonderful thing about the Beaver is the manner
in which he builds dams, to make ponds deep enough for
his timber-floating operations, and to afford him a submarine
passage to his house. Give him a valley and a
stream of water, and he will gladly make a pond out of
whatever raw materials are at hand. He uses the four-foot
sticks from which he has eaten the bark for food, and with
these, and an abundance of mud, he will raise a good strong
dam to a height of four feet, and a width on the ground of
ten feet or more. The mud used is dug out of the bottom
and sides of his pond, and carried, while swimming, between
his paws, with his front feet holding it against his
breast. The sticks used in the dam are thrust endwise into
the mud on top of the dam, and the mud used is patted
down with his fore feet. The tail is not used as a trowel,
but in swimming it is the Beaver&rsquo;s propeller.</p>
<p>In captivity the Beaver is not wholly a satisfactory animal.
Like some human craftsmen, he positively declines to work
under observation, and performs nearly all his tasks at
night. He thinks nothing of gnawing down a tree a foot
in diameter, and cutting its limbs into pieces which he can
handle while swimming. If he can secure enough food-wood
of kinds of his liking, he eats little else. Besides
building dams to create ponds in which he can take refuge
when hard pressed, he constructs canals, and houses for
winter use. He also digs burrows into high banks; but his
entrances to his various homes always are under water.</p>
<h3 id="c33">THE ECONOMIC RODENT-REPTILE COLLECTION.</h3>
<p>As an answer to a frequent question&mdash;&ldquo;Of what use are
reptiles?&rdquo;&mdash;a new collection has been installed in the
Reptile House. It is supplied with descriptive labels, and
serves several purposes. In the first place there is presented
an elaborate series of the small gnawing animals, or rodents,
a number of the species of which are highly injurious to the
interests of agriculturists; secondly, the exhibition contains
a large series of those species of snakes that prey upon the
destructive rodents,&mdash;thus presenting for observation the
serpents of marked economic value. Finally, the entire
series stands as a clear demonstration of the perfect logic of
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
Nature in which the production of all animal life is carefully
balanced; for a part of the exhibition is composed of
representative species of mammals that, in turn, prey upon
the serpents, thus keeping even the destroyers of the smaller
injurious creatures within bounds!</p>

<h2>SECTION II.&mdash;BIRDS.</h2>
<h3 id="c34">THE GOOSE AVIARY, No. 3.</h3>
<p>There are no birds which take more kindly to captivity,
or which better repay their keep and their keepers, than the
ducks, geese, swans and pelicans. The only drawback to
the maintenance of large collections of these birds in this
latitude is the annual struggle with our arctic winter. On
account of the fierce winter storms to which we must pay
tribute, many species of swimming birds require to be taken
out of their aviary, and housed in sheltered buildings, with
moderate warmth. For this reason the pelicans, tree-ducks
of all species, and all species from the tropics, must necessarily
be absent in winter from their summer quarters.</p>
<p>For the accommodation of a large, systematic collection of
wild geese, an aviary two hundred and fifty feet long by
one hundred and forty-three feet in width has been constructed
in the north end of Bird Valley. To secure as much
space as possible, the entire width of the open valley has
been taken into the enclosure.</p>
<p>The Goose Aviary consists of a pond containing three
islands, two of which are subdivided by low fences of wire
netting into twelve separate enclosures. The collection of
geese has become so large and important the original Duck
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Aviary has been taken for it, and the Ducks will hereafter
be found on the Wild-Fowl Pond and in the Flying Cage.</p>
<p><b>The Geese.</b>&mdash;The collection of wild geese, in the Goose
Aviary, is unusually large, there being generally about
twenty out of the thirty-five known species. Among these
one of the best known is the <b>Common Wild</b>, or <b>Canada
Goose</b>, (<i>Branta canadensis</i>). Once common throughout
many parts of the United States, continual persecution by
sportsmen and market hunters has so generally reduced its
numbers that now it is of comparatively rare occurrence.</p>
<p>This exceeding rarity made the arrival of nine superb wild
specimens on November 8, 1900, on the Wild-Fowl Pond, a
most interesting event. Seven of the birds, including a fine
gander, through the artifice of a trap, were induced to remain
with us, and have taken up a peaceful abode on the
little lake, with others of their kind presented by Mr. A. B.
Frost.</p>
<p><b>The African Spur-Winged Goose</b>, (<i>Plectropterus gambensis</i>),
although of large size, is more properly a duck than a
goose. A long sharp spur arises from the bend of each
wing, which the birds use in fighting with each other for
their mates.</p>
<p><b>The Gray-Lag Goose</b>, (<i>Anser anser</i>), is, perhaps, the
most interesting of all geese, as being the wild species from
which our domestic birds are descended. The white color
and large size are the chief differences between the domestic
and wild birds.</p>
<p><b>The White-Fronted Goose</b>, (<i>Anser albifrons</i>), is worthy of
special notice because it is the handsomest of the ten species
of North American geese. The breeding grounds are far
to the north, and in Alaska the nests are mere hollows in
the sand, lined with moss and down.</p>
<p><b>The Bar-Headed Goose</b>, (<i>Eulabia indica</i>), inhabits the
mountains of Central Asia, nesting always over a mile above
the sea. It is perhaps the handsomest of all geese.</p>
<p><b>The Swans.</b>&mdash;Usually at least six out of the seven known
species of swans may be seen on exhibition here.</p>
<p><b>The Mute Swan</b>, (<i>Cygnus olor</i>), is the commonest swan in
captivity, and is the one made famous in European history
and legend. It may always be known from the other species
by the black knob at the base of the bill. It breeds
freely in captivity and the young birds are known as
cygnets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p><b>The Trumpeter Swan</b>, (<i>Cygnus buccinator</i>), being the largest
bird in the aviary, and also snowy white, is therefore
the most conspicuous. Several fine specimens are shown on
the North Island, living contentedly with other species.
Some of these specimens were captured in Idaho, when
young enough to take kindly to captivity.</p>
<p><b>The Black Swan</b>, (<i>Chenopsis atrata</i>), of South Australia
and Tasmania, is as glossy black, excepting its primaries,
as other swans are white. It is a large and handsome bird,
and much sought by all persons who form collections of
water fowl.</p>
<p><b>The Coscoroba Goose</b>, (<i>Coscoroba coscoroba</i>), is a fair connecting
link between the swans and the ducks, partaking
about equally of the characters of each. In size and color
it is very much like our snow goose, (<i>Chen hyperborea</i>), but
it is peculiar in possessing very long legs of a bright pink
color, by which it is quickly recognized. Its bill, also is
pink, and the tips of its primaries are black. The Coscoroba
Goose is a native of southern South America, and a few years
ago specimens were so rare in captivity that a pair sold
for $300.</p>
<h3 id="c35">THE FLYING CAGE, No. 4.</h3>
<p>This mammoth bird-cage is one of the wonders of the
Zoological Park. It represents an attempt to do for certain
large and showy water birds, precisely what has been done
for the hoofed animals, the beaver, otter, and other species&mdash;give
them a section of Nature&rsquo;s own domain. In this
they can fly to and fro, build nests and rear their young in
real freedom.</p>
<p>Near the lower end of Bird Valley, as a sort of climax
for the Goose Aviary when seen from the north, rises a lofty,
web-like structure, in the form of a huge, gothic arch. It is
55 feet in height, 75 feet wide, and 152 feet long. The
whole structure consists of a series of steel-pipe arches and
purlins, the former eight feet apart, over which wire-netting
has been tightly stretched.</p>
<p>The wire-netting seems peculiarly open. It is of the kind
known as chain-netting, which offers the least possible
obstruction to the eye. This cage is so large that a very
respectable block of houses, three stories high and of ample
dimensions, could stand within it without touching the wire.
It completely encloses three forest trees of very considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
size, two hickories and an oak; and it contains a pool
of water a hundred feet long, and shrubbery in abundance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig77">
<img src="images/pmg084.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="410" />
<p class="pcap">CEREOPSIS GEESE.</p>
</div>
<p>The idea of a very large cage for herons and egrets, is not
new, for there are in existence several other flying cages,
somewhat smaller than this. The first was erected in the
Rotterdam Zoological Garden by its Director, the late Dr.
A. Von Bemmelin, whose experiment proved very successful.
Others are at London and in Paris Jardin d&rsquo;Acclimatation.</p>
<p>The Flying Cage is the summer home of a mixed flock of
such large and showy water birds as are most inclined to
fly about within it, and afford students and the public an
opportunity to study their movements and attitudes. Save
for such allowances as must be made for accidents and
epidemics, this enclosure will contain the following noteworthy
species, along with others of less importance:</p>
<p><b>The American Flamingo</b>, (<i>Phoenicopterns ruber</i>), is, in
appearance, a connecting link between the herons and
ducks, resembling the former in the great length of its legs,
and the latter in the duck-like bill and webbed feet. When
the plumage of this species is perfect, it is of a beautiful
scarlet color throughout, excepting the primaries, which
are black. In captivity, the color fades somewhat. This
bird is found in the Bahama Islands and Cuba, but in Florida,
where once it was fairly numerous, it no longer exists.
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Fortunately, this remarkable bird takes kindly to captivity,
and the Zoological Park is never without a good-sized flock.
Their strange form, showy colors and droll attitudes render
them unusually interesting to visitors.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig78">

<img src="images/pmg085a.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">ROSEATE SPOONBILL.</p>
</div>
<p>With the birds of the above species are shown a few specimens
of the <b>European Flamingo</b>, (<i>P. roseus</i>), which is almost
white. The only parts which show the characteristic
scarlet of this genus, are the wing coverts, which are pale
red, or pink.</p>
<p><b>The Scarlet Ibis</b>, (<i>Guara rubra</i>), is for its size the most
showy bird in existence, not even excepting the birds of
paradise. Excepting the black primaries, every feather on
the adult bird in perfect plumage is of a brilliant Chinese
vermilion color, visible in nature for a long distance. The
immature birds are mottled and patched with white. This
species once came as far north as southern Florida, but now
it is found only from Cuba southward. They frequent the
mud banks at the various mouths of the Orinoco, and not
long since were quite abundant on the coast of British
Guiana.</p>
<p><b>The White-Faced Glossy Ibis</b>, (<i>Plegadis guarauna</i>), is not
a rare bird in captivity, and it will doubtless be possible to
maintain this species perpetually in the Flying Cage and
Aquatic-Bird House.</p>
<p><b>The Wood Ibis</b>, (<i>Tantalus loculator</i>).&mdash;The Park obtains
its supply of birds of this species from Florida, where they
breed, in very greatly reduced numbers, on the headwaters
of the St. Johns. This bird is a very satisfactory member of
avian society. Although amply large to lord it over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
other birds of the cage, he quarrels with none, but peacefully
goes his way, feeling with the point of his beak along
the sandy bottom of the pool for something edible, or standing
in quiet meditation on the bank. Notwithstanding its
common name, this bird is not an ibis, but a true stork. In
its black and white plumage it is quite a handsome bird.
Although not so fond of using its wings in captivity as are
herons and egrets, the Wood Ibis is for many reasons a very
welcome tenant.</p>
<p><b>The White Stork</b>, (<i>Ciconia ciconia</i>), is as large as our
wood ibis, which it strongly resembles in form and habits.
This bird is literally the household bird of Germany, and its
place in the family has now become of more importance
than its place in nature. Throughout Holland, Germany,
and very nearly the whole of eastern and central Europe,
the White Stork is so prized and protected by the people
that it has attained a state of semi-domestication. Nesting
places are prepared for it, usually near or even upon human
habitations, and it enjoys an immunity from molestation
quite like that of the adjutant in India.</p>
<p><b>The Great Blue Heron</b>, (<i>Ardea herodias</i>), is frequently
called the &ldquo;blue crane&rdquo;; but the latter name is a misnomer.
It properly belongs to our sandhill crane (<i>Grus canadensis</i>).
Just why so large a number of people should be so persistent
in this error is a psychological problem; but the fact
remains that people will not say &ldquo;heron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Great Blue Heron is the largest and most noteworthy
bird of our northern marshes. Thanks to the fact that it
bears no desirable &ldquo;plumes,&rdquo; and its flesh is not edible, it
has been permitted to live. When not molested, it becomes
quite trustful, and when wading along a shore, fishing for
minnows, it affords for the field-glass or the camera a very
interesting subject. In summer these birds are quite numerous
in the marshes along the Shrewsbury River, between
Sandy Hook and Long Branch, and they are an unfailing
source of interest to excursionists. It is sincerely to be
hoped that the evil eye of &ldquo;Dame Fashion&rdquo; will not fall
upon this bird, and cause its extermination.</p>
<p><b>The Great White Heron</b>, (<i>Ardea americana</i>), is taller than
the great blue heron, and it is the largest of all the white
herons and egrets. Like the whooping crane, it is now a
bird of such exceeding rarity that the procuring of a specimen
may be counted a stroke of good fortune. In eight
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
years the Zoological Park has secured only three specimens,
all of which came from southern Florida.</p>
<p><b>The Little Blue Heron</b>, (<i>Florida caerulea</i>).&mdash;The immature
birds of this species are snowy white, and so closely
resemble snowy herons of the same age, that only one well
acquainted with both can distinguish between them. They
are, however, separately recognized by the fact that the
snowy heron has black legs, and a black bill, whereas the
legs and bill of the Little Blue Heron are pale yellow. This
species is still common in some parts of its Florida home,
and occasionally a specimen strays as far north as Staten
Island.</p>
<p><b>The Louisiana Heron</b>, (<i>Hydranassa tricolor ruficollis</i>), once
very numerous in Florida, is still found there, but in greatly
reduced numbers. It ranges from Central America and the
West Indies northward to the Gulf States, and occasionally
to Long Island. The general coloring is dark blue, but a
prominent distinguishing character is the chestnut brown
on the sides of the neck.</p>
<p><b>The Black-Crowned Night Heron</b>, (<i>Nycticorax nycticorax
naevius</i>), is one of the commonest herons about New York
City and occasionally nests in the Park itself. It breeds in
large colonies, and feeds chiefly at night. Its note is a
hoarse <i>quok</i>, very much like the bark of a dog.</p>
<p><b>The Snowy Heron</b>, or <b>Snowy Egret</b>, (<i>Egretta candidissima</i>),
when fully adult, is the most beautiful white bird in
all the avian world. Its form is the embodiment of symmetry
and grace, its plumage is immaculate, and the filmy
&ldquo;plumes&rdquo; on its head and back are like spun glass. Its
black legs and bill merely serve to intensify the whiteness
of its feathers. The vanity of woman has been the curse of
the Snowy Egret. Its plumes are finest during the breeding
season, and it was then that the hunters sought them,
slaughtering the old birds in the rookeries by thousands
(when they were abundant), and leaving the nestlings to
die of starvation. If all women could know the price in
blood and suffering which is paid for the accursed &ldquo;aigrettes&rdquo;
of fashion, surely but few could find any pleasure
in wearing them. It is strange that civilized woman&mdash;the
tender-hearted, the philanthropic, and the ever-compassionate&mdash;should
prove to be the evil genius of the world&rsquo;s most
beautiful birds.</p>
<p>In the United States the Snowy Egret now exists only by
accident, and the &ldquo;plume hunters&rdquo; are pursuing this and
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
the following species in Central and South America, to their
most remote haunts, sometimes even at the risk of their
lives. Fashion has decreed that the egrets must go.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig80">
<img src="images/pmg086.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="377" />
<p class="pcap">BROWN AND WHITE PELICANS.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The American Egret</b>, (<i>Herodias egretta</i>).&mdash;Much to the
misfortune of this species, it possesses about fifty &ldquo;aigrette&rdquo;
plumes which droop in graceful curves from the middle of
its back far beyond the tail and wing tips. For these beautiful
feathers this bird has been pursued by plume hunters
almost to the point of total extermination in the United
States.</p>
<p><b>The White Pelican</b>, (<i>Pelecanus erythrorhynchus</i>), is one of
the largest birds of North America and by reason of its
size, its pure white plumage, its enormously long amber-colored
bill and gular pouch, it is one of the most showy
birds in the aviary. As consumers of fish they stand pre-eminent
among birds, and their only rivals in the Park are
the sea-lions. The specimens exhibited were collected for the
Society in southern Texas.</p>
<p><b>The Brown Pelican</b>, (<i>Pelecanus occidentalis</i>), when adult,
is a handsome and showy bird, and one which not only is
easily reconciled to life in a comfortable aviary, but positively
enjoys it. The specimens in our collection were collected
for the Society on Pelican Island, Florida, and their
interesting home life at that place may be studied from the
series of photographs on exhibition in the Aquatic Bird
House. When their daily allowance of fish appears they
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
crowd around their keeper, and with wide-open pouches
earnestly solicit contributions.</p>
<h3 id="c36">THE AQUATIC BIRD HOUSE, No. 5.</h3>
<p>This building is the result of an attempt to solve an old
problem in a new way&mdash;the care of large migratory water
birds in the most uneven winter climate on earth. In comparison
with the care in winter of flamingoes, large herons,
egrets, ibises, and the like, the housing of perching birds,
birds of prey and the parrots, presents few difficulties. But
the wealth of fine water birds in North America alone, and
the interest attaching to them, seem to justify the labor
and expense that have been involved in this building and
its appointments. Practically all of the birds to be seen in
this building in winter are mentioned elsewhere in this
volume.</p>
<p><b>THE OWL CAGES.</b>&mdash;After the completion of the Eagle
and Vulture Aviary, the ten large cages on the exterior of
the Aquatic-Bird House, which have been occupied temporarily
by the birds of prey, will be used for the owl collection.</p>
<p><b>The Giant Eagle Owl</b>, (<i>Bubo bubo</i>), is a true giant among
the owls. It is found throughout continental Europe, keeping
mostly to the deep forests, and feeding on grouse, rabbits,
etc. It is unusually long-lived in captivity, and breeds
freely.</p>
<p><b>The Milky Eagle Owl</b>, (<i>Bubo lacteus</i>), has the same general
characters as its congener, but its feathers are of a
beautiful, soft gray. It is very rare in collections.</p>
<p><b>The Great Horned Owl</b>, (<i>Bubo virginianus</i>).&mdash;These nocturnal
birds of prey inhabit heavily wooded regions, feeding
on mice, and poultry when it is obtainable. The bright
yellow iris, the conspicuous feather horns, and the apparently
pivoted neck are curious features of these birds.
Their reputation for wisdom is founded only on their external
appearance, for in reality they are rather dull birds.</p>
<p><b>The Snowy Owl</b>, (<i>Nyctea nyctea</i>), of the Arctic regions,
migrating in winter to the northern United States, sometimes
remains for several seasons in succession so far north
that no specimens are obtainable. During 1899, 1900, and
the first half of 1901, not one specimen could be procured,
but in the late autumn of 1901 a southward migration began.
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
On June 1, 1911, the Park exhibited six fine specimens,
one of which was almost pure white. During the
three hottest months of summer, these birds would suffer
considerably, so during this period they are confined in a
cool, dark cellar, thus keeping in perfect health and comfort
throughout the year.</p>

<p class="pcap">SPECTACLED OWL.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Screech Owl</b>, (<i>Otus asio</i>).&mdash;This little horned owl is
our commonest species, and frequents the neighborhood of
dwellings and orchards. Being nocturnal it is more common
than is generally supposed, and its curious cry, which
is not a screech, but a musical, quavering series of notes, is
the cause most frequently leading to its discovery. Its two
phases of plumage, red and gray, occur independently of
sex, age or season. Its food consists of mice and insects.</p>
<p><b>The Barred Owl</b>, (<i>Syrnium varium</i>).&mdash;This owl is more
diurnal than its nearest relatives, and often hunts its prey
in bright moonshine. Its deep, penetrating call, &ldquo;woo-o-o,
whoo-o-o,&rdquo; is one of the most weird and striking cries of the
bird world. Another peculiarity, common to all owls, but
more noticeable in this less nocturnal species, is the absolutely
noiseless flight. The soft, downy feathers of the owl
permit it to wing its way through the air with as little noise
as a falling leaf.</p>

</div>
<p>The Eagle and Vulture Aviary stands in an open glade,
but well surrounded by forest trees, in Bird Valley, between
the Aquatic Bird House and the new Zebra House.
It is a commodious and pleasant installation, well adapted
to exhibit the Society&rsquo;s collection of rapacious birds. Its
length over all is 210 feet. It has seven very large flight
cages and six smaller ones. The largest cages are 24 feet
wide, 33 feet deep and 31 feet high. In the rear of the
great wire structure will stand a very comfortable brick
building to serve as a winter shelter for the tropical birds
of the collection; but it will not be open to the public.</p>
<p>Now that our eagles and vultures are to be brought together,
visitors will find that the collection is a large one,
and contains many fine species.</p>
<p><b>The Condor</b>, (<i>Sarcorhamphus gryphus</i>), of the Andes, is the
largest of the birds of prey, having a wing-spread of over
nine feet. It feeds entirely on carrion, rarely attacking living
animals. In the male, the head is adorned with a large
fleshy comb, much like that of a barn-yard cock. The Society
at present possesses several specimens of this great
bird.</p>
<p><b>The King Vulture</b>, (<i>Gypagus papa</i>), is as its proud name
implies, the one member of the Vulture Family which really
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
is clad in royal robes, and color-decked to match. Its range
extends from Mexico and Central America to Trinidad and
Brazil. The visitor should not fail to see this gorgeously
caparisoned body of white, cream-yellow and black, and
head of orange, purple and crimson.</p>
<p><b>Black Vulture</b>, (<i>Catharista urubu</i>).&mdash;These ill-favored but
very useful birds are quite abundant, and even semi-domesticated,
in some of our southern cities. This is due to the
protection accorded them, because of their valuable services
as scavengers. They are said to devour every particle of
exposed organic refuse, and in a warm climate these services
are of more value than we in the north can realize.</p>
<p><b>The Yellow-Headed Vulture</b>, (<i>Cathartes urobitinga</i>), of
northern South America, is a much handsomer bird than
its two preceding relatives. It has much the same feeding
habits, but is very rare and delicate in captivity.</p>
<p><b>The California Condor</b>, (<i>Gymnogyps californianus</i>).&mdash;This
is one of the rarest, and to all Americans the most interesting,
bird of prey in the Park. The species is confined to a
very small area in the rugged mountains of southern and
lower California, and beyond all doubt, the skin-collecting
ornithologists will exterminate it within the next twenty
years, or less.</p>
<p><b>The Griffon Vulture</b>, (<i>Gyps pulvus</i>), and the Kolbe Vulture,
(<i>G. kolbi</i>), are Old World birds and although more
closely related to the eagles than to the vultures of the New
World, resemble the latter in general habits.</p>
<p>Differing strongly from its congeners in general appearance,
is the <b>Eared Vulture</b>, (<i>Otogyps auricularis</i>). This rare
bird is a native of North Africa, where it feeds on such carrion
as it is able to find. Its bare, wrinkled head and neck
and great bill give it a decidedly gruesome appearance.</p>
<p><b>The Red-Tailed Hawk</b>, (<i>Buteo borealis</i>).&mdash;The &ldquo;Hen
Hawk,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chicken Hawk,&rdquo; is one of our commonest birds
of prey. It hardly merits its common name, as its favorite
food is mice and other small mammals. This is the hawk
seen, in the fall of the year, going south in flocks, sometimes
of one hundred or more.</p>
<p>One of the most splendid members of the collection is the
<b>Harpy Eagle</b>, (<i>Thrasaetus harpyia</i>), of South America. The
remarkably large legs and claws indicate the great strength
which enables the bird to prey upon sloths, monkeys, and
other fairly large animals.</p>

</div>
<p><b>The Lammergeyer</b> or <b>Bearded Vulture</b>, (<i>Gypaetus barbatus</i>),
is now probably extinct in Europe, but is still found in
parts of Asia. It feeds largely on lambs.</p>
<p>A nearly cosmopolitan bird is the <b>Golden Eagle</b>, (<i>Aquila
chrysaetos</i>). It is equally at home in the highlands of Scotland
and the mountains of North America, nesting on the
highest cliffs.</p>
<p><b>The Bateleur Eagle</b>, of Africa, (<i>Helotarsus ecaudatus</i>), has
narrowly missed the distinction of being the most beautiful
of all birds of prey. Its plumage is charmingly colored
but it is out of proportion. Its tail is so absurdly short
that its wings quite conceal it, and make it appear as if
altogether tailless.</p>

<p><b>Bald Eagle</b>, (<i>Halia&euml;tus leucocephalus</i>).&mdash;The appearance
of the adult Bald Eagle, our National emblem, with its conspicuous
white head and tail, is familiar to all; but the immature
birds, as shown by several of the specimens, lack the
white in their plumage. These birds are found usually near
water, and their food is chiefly fish. These they sometimes
catch for themselves, but if ospreys are found in the vicinity,
they are watched by the eagles, and often robbed of their
hard-earned prey.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fiercest among all the hawks is the <b>White
Gyrfalcon</b>, (<i>Falco islandus</i>). A native of the far north, it
descends to a more equable clime only when forced to do
so by scarcity of food. It is so swift of wing that it is able
to capture a duck in full flight.</p>
<p>Sea snakes form the rather unusual food of the <b>White-Breasted
Sea Eagle</b>, (<i>Halia&euml;tus leucogaster</i>), of the East
Indies, while the strikingly-colored <b>Vulturine Sea Eagle</b>,
(<i>Gypohierax angolensis</i>), a native of Africa, feeds on fish,
crabs, and the fruit of the oil palm.</p>
<h3 id="c38">THE WILD TURKEY ENCLOSURE, No. 33.</h3>
<p>At the northern end of Squirrel Ridge, where the Alligator
Walk intersects the Rodent Walk, an ideal quarter of
an acre, of oak and hickory trees, underbrush, and bare rock,
has been dedicated to the king of game birds.</p>
<p><b>The Wild Turkey</b>, (<i>Meleagris gallopavo silvestris</i>), is a
bird of magnificent size and presence, and the splendid metallic
luster of his plumage&mdash;a mixture of burnished bronze
copper, lapis lazuli, and fire opal iridescence&mdash;backed up
by a great bulk of savory flesh, all combine to make this the
finest game bird on earth. It was once fairly abundant
throughout the eastern United States, and still is found in
Pennsylvania, southern Ohio, Virginia and other southern
states as far west as Texas. Three other species of <i>Meleagris</i>
are now recognized&mdash;one in Florida, one in southern
Texas and northeastern Mexico, and the fourth in Mexico,
extending to western Texas and Arizona.</p>
<h3 id="c39">THE LARGE BIRD-HOUSE, No. 7.</h3>
<p>On the northwest quarter of Baird Court stands the largest
and the most generously equipped home for perching
birds now in existence. This is not an unnecessary boast,
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
but merely a brief statement of a fact which the visitor has
a right to know. It was designed on our long-established
principle that every captive wild creature is entitled to
life, exercise and happiness. Our principle of very large
cages, with many birds in each cage, is just the reverse of
the views that have prevailed in the older zoological gardens,
even down to the present day. To an important extent, the
cage equipment of this building represents a new departure.
There are many zoologists with experience longer than ours
who believe that small birds thrive better and live longer
when installed in small cages, with only one or two birds in
each.</p>

</div>
<p>The Large Bird-House, specially designed for Passerine
birds, was developed on the strength of experiments previously
made in the Aquatic-Bird House, and in community
cages outside. After three years&rsquo; experience with the
new building, and a careful tabulation of diseases and death
rates within it, we are able to state that this installation
is a complete and gratifying success.</p>
<p>The Large Bird-House is an L-shaped building, with an
all-glass house in its angle. The main hall extends east and
west, and it is 60 feet long by 50 feet wide. This great
room contains the foreign song-birds, many tropical doves
and pigeons, and such tropical varieties and oddities as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
great crowned pigeons, tinamous, toucans, giant king-fishers
and hornbills. In the great central flying cage there is perhaps
the most remarkable <i>omnium-gatherum</i> of small tropical
birds&mdash;swimmers, waders, upland game birds and perchers&mdash;ever
brought together in one cage. The bottom of
the L is the Parrots&rsquo; Hall, 65&times;30 feet. It contains the parrots,
macaws, cockatoos, and a few other species.</p>

<p>In the angle of the main building stands a structure almost
wholly composed of metal and glass, which is known as
the Glass Court. It was designed especially for North American
song-birds. The visitor should not overlook the fact
that there are cages filled with birds all along both the eastern
and western sides of the Large Bird House.</p>
<p>Nearly all the cages of both the exterior and interior of
the Main and Parrots&rsquo; Halls, are accessible from the back
by passage-ways; a convenience that greatly facilitates the
work of the keepers in caring for their various charges.</p>
<p>The capacity of this installation as a whole may be judged
from the following memorandum of cages:</p>

<p>Regarding the state of health and spirits of the birds in
this building, the visitor must be left to judge for himself.
It is only fair to state, however, that the death rate here
and indeed amongst the birds of the Park generally, is
<i>very low</i>.</p>
<p>In view of the great number of avian species inhabiting
the Large Bird-House, it is a practical impossibility to give
more than a general outline of the groups and leading features
of the collection.</p>
<p>As the visitor enters at the south door, nearest the Lion
House, he is greeted by a discordant chorus of ear-piercing
shrieks and squawks, joyous but very raucous, and at times
too persistent. Loudest are the voices of the gorgeously-plumaged
Blue-and-Yellow Macaw, (<i>Ara ararauna</i>); the Red-and-Blue
Macaw, (<i>Ara macao</i>), and the Great Green Macaw.
Around their cages there is no such thing as stagnation or
somnolence. The soft-hued Rosella Parakeets, the flock of
mostly-green Cuban Parrots, the Leadbeater Cockatoos and
the White Cockatoos all join in their voices, to the limit of
their respective abilities, but against macaws which can be
heard a mile, their best efforts seem tame. The members of
the Order <i>Psittaciformes</i> (as above) have been beautifully
colored by Nature, and their harsh voices seem strangely
out of harmony with their plumage.</p>
<p>The indoor cages along the western side of the Large
Bird-House (both halls included), contain an extensive
series of tropical Pigeons and Doves, which are well worth
some attention.</p>
<p>The most startling exhibit in this group is the Bleeding
Heart Pigeon (<i>Phlogoenas luzonica</i>), from the Philippines,
whose creamy-white breast seems to have been recently
stabbed with a stiletto. It is no wonder that now and
then a sympathetic visitor seeks the curator, or a keeper,
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
and reports that a bird has been injured, and is bleeding
from a wound in its breast.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig92">
<img src="images/pmg099.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398" />
<p class="pcap">GREAT CROWNED PIGEON.</p>
</div>
<p>The Flying Cage in the center of the Main Hall contains
a pool of running water, some small trees, an imitation rock,
and the floor is covered with a comfortable layer of sand.
Hopping or flying about, and perching on the trees, is a
really remarkable medley of birds. There are the Wood Duck
and Mandarin Duck, Black Skimmers, Common and Sooty
Terns, several species of Teal, Curlews, Gallinules, Coots,
Lapwings, Snipe, Ruffs, Quail, Francolins, Senegal, Turtle,
Wonga-wonga and other Pigeons and Doves, Skylarks,
Robins, Orioles, Cardinals, Woodpeckers, Java, Fox, Tree,
and other Sparrows and Weavers.</p>
<p>The south side of the Main Hall is devoted to miscellaneous
rare birds from the tropics, regardless of the Orders to
which they belong. The largest are the Great Crowned
Pigeons,&mdash;Victoria and Common,&mdash;the oddest are the Concave-Casqued
Hornbills and the Toucans (eight species).
The Rufous Tinamou, of South America, is a species which,
through lack of use for its wings, is rapidly losing the
power of flight. The Giant Kingfisher is the &ldquo;Laughing
Jackass&rdquo; of Australia, and its cry is strangely like the
mirthless horse-laugh of a man who has few smiles and
seldom uses one. The Himalayan Jay-Thrush is so confirmed
a murderer of birds smaller than himself, it is necessary
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
to quarter that species with other birds abundantly
able to defend themselves against its attacks.</p>

<p class="pcap">TOCO TOUCAN.</p>
</div>
<p>On the northern side of the Main Hall there will be found
a very interesting group of Cuban birds, another of birds of
the Bahamas, a fair-sized collection of Finches, Weavers,
Canaries, Trogons, and other small species of foreign lands.
Here also is the rare and beautifully-plumed Greater Bird
of Paradise, (<i>Paradisea apoda</i>).</p>
<p>The visitor is reminded that for all cages that contain
more than one species, the picture labels quickly furnish a
key for identification of each.</p>
<p>In the Glass Court and around it, the Curator of Birds,
Mr. C. William Beebe, has scored a gratifying success in
the installation of the Order <i>Passeres</i>. The birds are arranged
by Families, and <i>all of the twenty-one families of
eastern North American perching birds are represented</i>.
These Families are as follows: Flycatchers, Swallows, Wrens,
Mockingbirds and Catbirds, Thrushes, Kinglets, Vireos,
Waxwings, Shrikes, Chickadees, Nuthatches, Brown
Creepers, Warblers, Pipits, Horned Larks, Sparrows, Honey
Creepers, Tanagers, Blackbirds and Orioles, English Starling,
Crows and Jays. It is only those who have attempted to
form and install such a collection who can appreciate the
effort which that collection has cost, or the difficulties involved
in the maintenance of so large a number of insect-eating
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
birds. The birds in this section of the Bird-House
are especially interesting to the teachers of pupils of the
public schools of this city.</p>
<p>The large circular flying cage, at the outer corner of the
Glass Court, is filled with Robins, Bluebirds, Thrushes and
Woodpeckers which winter there very comfortably, because
they are fed and watered, and sheltered from the
worst storms.</p>
<p>Along the western wall of the Large Bird-House, outside,
fourteen large cages are filled with members of the Crow
and Blackbird Families (<i>Corvidae</i> and <i>Icteridae</i>), such as
the Ravens, Crows, Jays, Magpies, Blackbirds, Meadowlarks,
Cowbirds and Grackles, beside which appear our old
friends the Yellow-Shafted Flicker and Red-Headed Woodpecker.</p>

<h3 id="c40">WILD-FOWL POND,
<br /><i>Heretofore Called the Aquatic Mammals&rsquo; Pond</i>.</h3>
<p>As the birds on this pond have been transferred from the
Duck Aviary, the interest of this exhibit is of special character,
and greatly enjoyed by hosts of visitors. This is
the nursery of the ducks and geese, where, in the tangle of
long grass, briars and underbrush along the east side of the
pond, the nests are built in early spring, the eggs are laid
and patiently incubated. Finally the broods of ducklings
are led to the water, to feed to repletion, throughout the
summer, on the worms, bugs and insects so dear to the appetite
of these amusing little fellows.</p>
<p>Cope Lake is the especial province of the nesting pairs of
Canada geese, and sometimes as many as eight golden-colored
goslings are hatched in one nest on the small island.</p>
<p><b>The Mallard Duck</b>, (<i>Anas boschas</i>), is one of our finest
swimming birds, the joy of the sportsman who finds it in
its haunts, the delight of the epicure who finds it on the bill
of fare. Sluggish indeed must be the blood which does not
beat faster at the sight of a flock of wild Mallards, free in
Nature, and ready to leap into the air and away at the
slightest alarm. After the pintail and the wood duck, this
is one of the handsomest ducks of North America, and also
one of the finest for the table. Its range covers practically
the whole of the western continent down to Panama, and
even extends to the Azores, north Africa, and northern India.
The drakes are readily recognized by the splendid irridescent
green of the head.</p>
<p><b>The Green-Winged Teal</b>, (<i>Nettion carolinensis</i>), and <b>Blue-Winged
Teal</b>, (<i>Querquedula discors</i>), are very delicate birds,
and therefore rather difficult to maintain in captivity. A
flock of each will be found in the Flying Cage.</p>
<p><b>The Pintail Duck</b>, (<i>Dafila acuta</i>), is specially commended
to the notice of visitors because of its great beauty, both
in color and form. Its colors form an exquisite harmony of
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
soft brown and gray tones which fairly rival the more
gaudy color-pattern of the wood duck. The species is yet
found occasionally along the Atlantic Coast, but like all
other edible birds, its numbers are rapidly diminishing.
A large flock of these birds will be found on the Wild-Fowl
Pond.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig95">
<img src="images/pmg102.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="382" />
<p class="pcap">DUCKS FEEDING: WILD FOWL POND.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Gadwall</b>, (<i>Chaulelasmas strepera</i>), is a handsome gray
bird, well known to gunners along the Mississippi Valley,
but rarely seen along the Atlantic coast. Its chief breeding
grounds are in the great marshes of central Canada.</p>
<p><b>The Baldpate</b>, (<i>Mareca americana</i>), one of the finest of
water-fowl, is now so scarce that it is difficult to obtain specimens
for exhibition. These birds are poor divers, but gain a
good livelihood by feeding on floating sea lettuce, disturbed
from the bottom by the better equipped canvas-backs and
redheads.</p>
<p>The bill of the <b>Shoveller</b>, (<i>Spatula clypeata</i>), has become so
specialized for mud-sifting that it has actually assumed the
shape of a shovel, and is out of all proportion to the size of
the bird&rsquo;s body. The sides of the bill are equipped with
bony plates, through which the mud is strained, the particles
of food being caught and swallowed.</p>
<p><b>The Canvas-Back</b> (<i>Aythya vallisneria</i>), and the <b>Red-Head</b>,
(<i>A. americana</i>), two prime favorites with the sportsman and
epicure, are exhibited on the Wild Fowl Pond. Of the latter,
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
a good-sized flock is shown. Canvas-Backs, however, are
difficult to capture unhurt, and still more difficult to keep
alive in captivity, and for these reasons the number exhibited
always is very small.</p>
<p><b>The Lesser Scaup</b>, (<i>Marila affinis</i>), is one of the sea ducks,
and, like its congeners, a very expert diver. It feeds chiefly
on mollusks, which it finds in the mud, often at considerable
depths under water.</p>
<p><b>The Paradise Sheldrake</b>, (<i>Casarca variegata</i>), of Australia,
is a striking bird, occupying a position mid-way between
the ducks and geese. It is interesting to note that the female
is much more attractive than the male, the head and
neck being pure white, in contrast with the more sombre
body. This species is very quarrelsome in captivity.</p>
<p><b>The Ruddy Sheldrake</b>, (<i>Casarca casarca</i>), is a bird of wide
distribution, being found from the Mediterranean countries
to Japan, and also in northeast Africa. Both sexes are of
a uniform light chestnut, the male being distinguished by
a black ring around the neck. The nest is always well
sheltered, often being placed in a hollow log.</p>
<p><b>The Common</b> or <b>Tadorna Sheldrake</b>, (<i>Tadorna tadorna</i>), is
a remarkably colored bird, but unfortunately difficult to
keep alive in this climate. It nests in holes in the ground,
preferably in disused rabbit burrows.</p>
<p><b>The Mandarin Duck</b>, (<i>Aix galericulata</i>), is the Chinese
counterpart of our beautiful <b>Wood</b> or <b>Summer Duck</b>, (<i>Aix
sponsa</i>). Of all living ducks, the males of these two species
are the most gorgeously colored and plumed, and they are
also of elegant form. Although both species are much
sought after, the number of available specimens continues
to be limited to a comparatively small number.</p>
<h3 id="c41">THE PHEASANT AND PIGEON AVIARY, No. 40.
<br /><i>Entire Collection is the Gift of Mr. Jacob H. Schiff.</i></h3>
<p>The Pheasant Aviary is a building like a corridor 240 feet
long with a cross pavilion at each end. The main structure
is divided into 22 shelters connecting with a like number of
wire enclosed outside runways, each of which is 8 feet wide,
24 feet long and 8 feet high. The two end pavilions furnish
32 smaller shelters and runways, making a total of 48 compartments.
The shelters are divided into two stories, the
upper series being designed for pigeons, doves and perching
birds of various kinds. Each bird in this aviary can at
every moment of his life choose according to his needs from
the following series of accommodations that are available
to him: An open, sunlit yard, a storm shelter with an open
front, or a closed room with one small door and a large
window.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>This beautiful and generous installation, 240 feet long,
with 48 runways, accommodates the true Pheasants of the
world, the largest group of birds of the Pheasant Family
(<i>Phasianidae</i>), which in turn is one of the grand divisions
of the sportsman&rsquo;s own Order <i>Gallinae</i>, or upland gamebirds.
Of the whole Order <i>Gallinae</i>,&mdash;which includes the
Grouse, Ptarmigan, Partridges, Pheasants, Turkeys, Guinea-Fowls,
Jungle Fowl, Quails, Brush-Turkeys, Curassows and
Guans&mdash;the group of the Pheasants can justly claim the distinction
of possessing the most beautiful birds. Indeed, I
think there is not to be found in the whole avian world a
group of game birds all the members of which, taken species
by species, are so gorgeously apparelled as these.</p>
<p>In this brief notice of what is really one of the finest
pheasant collections in the world, it is not possible to do
more than direct the visitors&rsquo; attention to its chief items of
interest. It must be stated well in advance, however, that
these are birds of very shy and retiring habit, which owe
their existence as species to the success with which they
retreat from danger, and conceal themselves from man and
beast. These birds must not be forced to spend all the daylight
hours in their runways; for some of them could not
long survive such exposure and excitement. To preserve
their lives, and keep them in health, they must have the
privilege of retiring into their shelters whenever they desire.
But they roam in and out, and by the exercise of a
little effort in returning to them, the interested visitor will
find no great difficulty in seeing all the species.</p>
<p>There are few species of pheasants whose members are
sufficiently peace-loving that many individuals can be kept
together without deadly combats. Of most species save the
golden, silver and ring-neck, the cocks are so quarrelsome
that even two can not be kept together; and this fact constitutes
a handicap upon those whose duty it is to maintain
the full strength of the exhibition. If a rare and quarrelsome
male pheasant dies unexpectedly, it is not always possible
to fill the vacancy on short notice.</p>
<p>Out of the half-dozen species which claim first place in
an enumeration based on beauty and luxuriance of plumage&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
Amherst, Reeve, golden, silver, impeyan, Argus
or Soemmerring&mdash;it is difficult to choose. Each has its share
of strong points, and it seems as if there is no &ldquo;finest of
all.&rdquo; Let us take them as they come to mind, for by reason
of the changes so often necessary in the runways, it is inexpedient
to attempt an end-to-end enumeration.</p>

<p class="pcap">MANCHURIAN EARED PHEASANT.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Golden Pheasant</b>, (<i>Chrysolophus pictus</i>), is a universal
favorite; and it well deserves its wide popularity.
Although small, it is as beautiful as the most entrancing
sunset ever seen. It is very alert and <i>chic</i>, it is so good
tempered that we can have the rare pleasure of seeing a
whole flock in one runway, and it is a good breeder. To
crown all these fine qualities, it is so hardy, and so competent
a &ldquo;rustler&rdquo; in seeking food that under fair conditions
it is easily transplanted from its native home in
western and southern China. It has been introduced and
acclimatized with gratifying success in Oregon, Washington,
southern British Columbia near the Pacific coast, and elsewhere.
In the shooting season, the shops of the taxidermists
of Vancouver and Portland are filled with these gorgeous
creatures, which appreciative sportsmen have found
&ldquo;too beautiful to eat.&rdquo; One might as well try to describe
a sunset as to pen a mental picture of the wonderful combination
of golden yellow, orange, lapis-lazuli blue and deep
crimson that appear in the plumage of this gorgeous bird.</p>
<p><b>The Amherst Pheasant</b>, (<i>Chrysolophus amherstiae</i>), is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
nearest relative to the golden species, and also a strong candidate
for first honors on the score of beauty. As far as
you can see the cock bird, you can recognize it by its marvellous
cape of pure white feathers marked with semicircles
of black and steel-blue, which reaches from its eyes far back
upon the shoulders. It is also easily recognized by its enormously
long tail, the middle feathers of which are conspicuously
marked by a regular series of diagonal bars of black
laid on a light ground color. This bird is of small size, and
fortunately for the public, it breeds in confinement with sufficient
readiness that a good supply for exhibition purposes is
thereby maintained.</p>

<p class="pcap">INDIAN PEACOCK.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Silver Pheasant</b>, (<i>Gennaeas nycthemerus</i>), of China,
is Nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;running mate&rdquo; for the golden pheasant, not
only in the rocky hill forests of southern China, but in
acclimatization, in captivity, and everywhere else. Wherever
you see a golden pheasant, look for the Silver also, with
its showy, snow-white tail, and white mantle of feathers
which covers the whole upper two-thirds of the bird from
its ears to its tail. Its dark-colored under surface serves well
to accentuate the whiteness of its other parts. It is a larger
bird than the golden and Amherst pheasants, but it is so
good tempered that every summer two or three cock birds
are kept in the great Flying Cage along with many small
and defenseless birds which might easily be molested. In
parks which are not visited by great numbers of people,
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
both this species and the golden are easily domesticated, and
permitted to roam at will.</p>
<p><b>The Reeves Pheasant</b>, (<i>Syrmaticus reevesi</i>), of northern
China, is a most beautiful species, closely related to the
Japanese, Elliott, Hume and Soemmerring pheasants,&mdash;all of
them fine, showy birds. Like the Amherst, the Reeves
Pheasant has a very long tail, which in fully adult or old
male birds often attains a length of five feet. When you
see in captivity a pheasant with an enormously long tail,
it is safe to assume that it is either an Amherst or a Reeves.</p>
<p><b>The Soemmerring Pheasant</b>, (<i>Phasianus soemmerringii</i>),
sometimes very aptly called the <b>Copper Pheasant</b>, is a native
of Japan, and a bird of which any country might well be
proud. In size, form and length of tail it matches the common
ring-necked pheasant. Its head and neck plumage is
of a warm copper-bronze tint, but its most beautiful colors
are found in the elaborate cross-bar markings of its tail.
The pattern of the latter reveals first a strong cross-bar of
chocolate brown, above that a broad band of fawn-color,
and this blends into a mottling of black on cream-color,
edged across with black.</p>
<p><b>The True Ring-Necked Pheasant</b>, (<i>P. torquatus</i>), of China,
brings to view a question that frequently is asked regarding
the <b>English Pheasant</b>, (<i>P. colchicus</i>), which is the common
species of southeastern Europe and Asia Minor, and of
Great Britain and other continental areas by <i>introduction</i>.
We are asked, &ldquo;Has the English Pheasant a white ring
around its neck, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer is, <i>the true, pure-blooded</i> English, or Common
Pheasant, (<i>P. colchicus</i>), has <i>no ring</i> around its neck; but so
many persons have crossed the true Ring-Necked Pheasant,
of China, with that species that in many flocks of the former
species the majority of the individuals are of mixed breed,
with necks perceptibly ringed, yet passing as English Pheasants.
As a matter of fact, in the world to-day, pure-blooded
English Pheasants are rare. Both the English and Ring-Necked
species have been successfully introduced into several
portions of the United States.</p>
<p>While on this subject, we will here record the fact that
the name Mongolian Pheasant, as often applied to the Ring-Neck,
is a misleading error. The real <b>Mongolian Pheasant</b>,
of Turkestan, (<i>P. mongolicus</i>), is a species of such extreme
rarity that it is almost unknown, alive, in the United States.
A fine pair of these birds is now on exhibition at the Pheasant
Aviary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p><b>The Argus Pheasant</b>, (<i>Argusianus argus</i>), is a bird with a
great reputation for beauty, but as seen alive in zoological
collections it does not always come up to expectations. Both
its secondary feathers&mdash;which when fully developed are of
enormous length&mdash;and its primaries, are extremely beautiful;
but unfortunately those beauties are not visible until
the bird is dead, and its plumage displayed in a manner
very rarely adopted by the living, captive bird. But the
eyes on the huge secondary feathers are wonderful, and each
primary is a dream in ecru and brown tints, laid on in a
most elaborate pattern. The Argus Pheasants are most shy
and wide-awake birds, inhabiting the dense, hot and moist
jungles of Borneo, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, and
are almost impossible to shoot. They are snared by the
Dyaks and Malays, and after the skin has been removed and
carefully preserved for museum purposes, the flesh is as fine
eating as the breast of a quail and quite as palatable. A
few successful attempts have been made to breed this
species in captivity.</p>
<p><b>The Impeyan Pheasant</b>, (<i>Lophophorus impeyanus</i>), is the
neighbor of the Himalayan tahr, the burrhel, the ibex and
the markhor, and the delight of every sportsman who dares
the rocks of &ldquo;the Roof of the World&rdquo; in quest of Himalayan
big game. Its beauty is due chiefly to its metallic colors,
and the splendid iridescence of its plumage. Its home is
in the world&rsquo;s most gigantic mountains, and it is not uncommon
for a bird that has flown out from a mountain-side
and been shot on the wing to fall 2,000 feet, and beyond
human reach. No wonder this bird is popular with Anglo-Indian
sportsmen.</p>
<p>The Pheasant Aviary is a <i>double installation</i>, and as an
aviary for Pigeons and Doves it is quite as perfect as it is
for Pheasants.</p>
<p>During the year 1910 and part of 1911, the pheasants
of the Old World were studied in their haunts by Mr. C.
William Beebe, Curator of Birds. By reason of a cash gift
to the Zoological Society made by Col. Anthony R. Kuser,
he was enabled to make the expedition. The results will be
embodied in an elaborate monograph, which probably will
be published in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="c42">THE OSTRICH HOUSE, No. 43.
<br /><i>This entire collection presented by the late Charles T. Barney.</i></h3>
<p>Originally it was our intention to devote this fine building
solely to the great &ldquo;running birds,&rdquo;&mdash;Ostriches, Rheas,
Emeus and Cassowaries; but the pressure for space has been
so great that this intention never has been carried into
effect, and we fear it never will be. There are so many
cranes, seriemas, tropical vultures and other large birds
which appeal for space in these very pleasant and healthful
quarters, we have felt compelled to set our original plan
half at naught. It seems probable that some of the feathered
interlopers now in the Ostrich House will remain there,
indefinitely&mdash;or at least until we erect a Crane Aviary.</p>
<p>Architecturally, the Ostrich House is the counterpart of
the Small-Mammal House, the two being identical in size
and form, and connected by a handsome pavilion. Each
building is 170 feet long, and 54 feet wide. The Ostrich
House contains 13 cages, each 10&times;12 feet, by 8 feet in height.
A flood of warm light pours through a glass roof into these
cages, and makes them as light as the yards without. It is
no wonder that birds thrive in this building. Movable partitions
were provided, so that a few of the cages might be
subdivided whenever necessary. This provision has proven
of much practical value.</p>
<p>Each interior cage connects with a spacious outside yard,
in which the big birds spend the warm months. The yards
are enclosed by wire fences, and to the eye of the visitor
they are open from three directions.</p>
<p>The members of the Subclass <i>Ratitae</i>,&mdash;once called the
Cursores, or the &ldquo;running birds,&rdquo;&mdash;are the present-day
giants of the avian world. We have reason to be glad that
all these splendid birds did not disappear from the earth
before ornithology took form as a science. Undoubtedly,
they mark the end of the line of birds of their kind, for the
far-reaching destructiveness of civilized man has already
put a period to the natural evolution of animal life. To-day,
the preservers of wild life are engaged in a hand-to-hand
struggle with the annihilators, over the preservation of a
remnant for those who come after us.</p>
<p><b>The African Ostriches</b> are now very prominently in the
public eye, not because of their relationship to the Dinornis
and Aepyornis of the past, but by reason of the value of
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
their plumes in enhancing the attractiveness of woman.
And surely, no plume-bearing bird ever enlisted in a better
cause, or on a more satisfactory basis; for to-day the plume
crop is being grown and plucked and marketed with almost
as much certainty as the annual crop of wool. In the
United States, the most important plume-producing ostrich
farms are situated in southern California and Arizona,
where the industry is quite successful. So valuable are the
adult birds that it is possible to purchase specimens imported
from Africa for less money than would be necessary
to procure them in the United States.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig99">
<img src="images/pmg106.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="390" />
<p class="pcap">NORTH AFRICAN OSTRICH: MALE.</p>
</div>
<p>A full-grown male African Ostrich stands 8 feet in height,
and weighs about 300 pounds. Its value on arrival in New
York, before acclimatization and moulting into perfect plumage,
is from $200 to $250. The female lays about 90 eggs
in a year, each of which is equal to about 20 hen&rsquo;s eggs.
The time of incubation is about 40 days. In captivity only
about 60 per cent of the eggs hatch, and of those not more
than one-half live to attain full maturity. The plumage of
immature birds and adult females is gray, but that of the
adult male is black on the body, and white on the wings and
tail.</p>
<p><b>The South African Ostrich</b>, (<i>Struthio australis</i>), differs
from the species found in the north. The color of the
naked skin of its neck and thighs, and the front scales on
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
its metatarsus, is distinctly bluish, and dark. This is the
species of the southern half of Africa, now so successfully
farmed in Cape Colony for its feathers that the annual
crop is said to yield about $5,000,000. And it is this species
which is kept on the ostrich farms of California and
Arizona.</p>

<p class="pcap">CASSOWARY.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The North African, or Sudan Ostrich</b>, (<i>S. camelus</i>), is the
species first and longest known. Its neck, thighs and front
metatarsal scales are of a decided pink color. Originally
the range of this species extended from north Africa well
into southwestern Asia, embracing Arabia, Syria and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the African Ostriches originally covered
all the open, sandy plains of Africa; but they never
inhabited the regions of dense forests. To-day their total
inhabited range is small, and rapidly becoming more so. It
is highly probable that within the life period of many persons
now living, wild Ostriches will totally disappear from
the earth.</p>
<p><b>The Common Rhea, or South American Ostrich</b>, (<i>Rhea
americana</i>), represents a group of ostriches much smaller
than those of Africa, and found only on the open plans of
Argentina and Patagonia, below the great equatorial forest
belt. There are three species in the group. In general
terms it may be stated that an adult Rhea is about two-thirds
the size of an adult African ostrich. It is with great
difficulty that these birds are reared to maturity in the
United States.</p>

<p class="pcap">EMEUS.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Common Emeu</b>, (<i>Dromacus novae-hollandiae</i>), of Australia,
is the neighbor of the kangaroo and wallaby, and in
form is as odd as are the majority of the birds and mammals
of that continent of strange creatures. Its body suggests a
pile of gray-brown hay elevated on stilts, to one end of
which a hay-covered neck and head have been attached. The
bird-lover should make much of this creature, for in its
home country it has been almost exterminated. Fortunately,
in climates reasonably well suited to it&mdash;but not in
or near New York&mdash;it is possible to breed this bird in captivity.
In size the Emeu is next to the African ostrich.</p>
<p><b>The Ceram Cassowary</b>, (<i>Casuarius casuarius</i>), of the
Island of Ceram, Malay Archipelago, represents a group
which contains a number of well-defined species which are
scattered through the northern cape of Australia, New
Guinea, the Aru Islands, Ceram, and other islands of Malayana
east of Celebes. They are all distinguished by their
glossy purple or black body plumage&mdash;which looks far more
like coarse hair than like feathers&mdash;their huge legs, and
their helmeted heads. The differences between species are
based chiefly upon the bright orange red and purple colors
of their upper necks and wattles.</p>
<p>In size the Cassowaries are all of them smaller than the
emeus. In captivity they are the best of all the large cursorial
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
birds, and live longer than either ostriches, rheas or
emeus. They are essentially birds of the thick forests rather
than open plains, and can not bear the glaring light and heat
of midsummer that is the delight of an ostrich. In captivity
they are very apt to be quarrelsome toward each other.</p>
<p><b>Miscellaneous Birds in the Ostrich House.</b>&mdash;At present
these are so numerous and so important it is necessary to
mention a few of them, even though the labels may be supposed
to speak for them. They fall into several groups, chiefly
birds of prey and cranes.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable creatures in the entire collection
is the <b>Secretary Bird</b>, (<i>Serpentarius serpentarius</i>). It is
well known as a snake killer, its attacks being made with
the feet alone, and never with the beak. Its long legs are remarkably
powerful, and capable of dealing a crushing blow,
always aimed at the head of the victim. Although it does
not resemble the hawks and eagles in general appearance,
it is in reality one of this group, and might well be described
as a &ldquo;hawk on stilts.&rdquo; The snakes, frogs, small animals
and birds which form its diet are generally swallowed entire.
The long cockades of black feathers falling backwards
at each side of the head are said to have suggested
the name Secretary Bird, from a fancied resemblance to a
quill stuck behind the ear of a clerk.</p>
<p><b>The Brush Turkey</b>, or <b>Telegalla</b>, (<i>Catheturus lathami</i>), is a
bird of the dark tropical forests of New Guinea and Australia.
For many years it has been regarded as a zoological
wonder, because of the remarkable manner in which it nests
and produces its young. Instead of building a small, hollow
nest, and hatching its eggs by the heat of its own body,
it pursues the plan of the crocodile! Choosing an open spot
in the forest it builds a huge mound, and as the structure
rises, it lays its eggs in the heart of it. Turning its tail to
the mound-site, this absurd little bird&mdash;no larger than a
barnyard hen&mdash;scratches about right and left, gathers a big
footful of small dead sticks, grass and dirt, and fiercely
flings it backward upon the pile. A Brush Turkey in good
working order can fling a bunch of jungle debris fully ten
feet. Usually the finished mound is about three feet high
by ten feet in diameter on the ground, and contains two or
three <i>cart-loads</i> of sticks, leaves and grass. The eggs are
deposited in a circle, well separated from each other, and
each newly hatched bird must scratch out or die. Of course,
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
the eggs are incubated by the heat of the sun and the fermentation
of the mass. When hatched, the young chicks are
able to fly.</p>

<h3 id="c43">THE CRANES.</h3>
<p>At present the Cranes of the Zoological Park are divided
between the Ostrich House and the Aquatic Bird House, and
their environs. In summer there are exhibits of these birds
in the outdoor yards adjacent to each of those buildings.
Recently, a number of species have been acclimatized in the
Crane Paddock, and are to be seen there winter and summer.</p>
<p><b>The Whooping Crane</b>, (<i>Grus americana</i>), is the largest, the
handsomest and the rarest crane species in America. Its
great size and its pure-white plumage&mdash;except its primaries&mdash;render
it conspicuous from afar, and its voice will carry
half a mile. The arched secondary wing feathers of the
adult give the bird a very jaunty appearance. This species
is so rare that thus far we have been able in eight years
to secure only three specimens. The Whooping Crane nests
in summer in the Arctic regions, but in winter it ranges
as far south as Mexico. Our specimens of this bird will in
summer be found in the large paddock immediately north
of the Aquatic Bird House, with the next species.</p>
<p><b>The Sandhill Crane</b>, (<i>Grus mexicana</i>), is smaller than the
preceding species, more common, and is frequently seen in
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
captivity. Its color is slaty-blue. It is found in the southeastern
United States, but once was fairly common throughout
the Mississippi valley. In captivity this bird often indulges
in some very droll antics&mdash;at times actually dancing.
The adult males are often quite pugnacious, and inclined to
attack those who go near them, and all visitors are warned
not to go within striking distance of them. Children especially
should not be permitted to climb over the guard wires,
and approach close up to the cranes&rsquo; fences.</p>

<p><b>The Sarus Crane</b>, of the plains and sand-bars of northern
India, (<i>Antigone antigone</i>), greatly resembles our sandhill
crane, but is a much larger bird. This also is a quarrelsome
species, and in captivity individuals are inclined to be cruel
toward each other.</p>
<p><b>The Asiatic White Crane</b>, (<i>Sarcogeranus leucogeranus</i>), is
like a modest understudy to our whooping crane, in all
respects save the elevated tail-crest. It is a bird of wide
distribution.</p>
<p><b>The Paradise Crane</b>, (<i>Tetrapteryx paradisea</i>), of the open
plains of Africa outside the deserts, is a slaty-blue bird with
a head so puffed out with side feathers that it looks almost
reptilian. Its tail-feathers taper out to infinity, and gracefully
droop quite to the ground. The little African <b>Demoiselle
Crane</b>, (<i>Anthropoides virgo</i>), is so diminutive, so
dainty in appearance and so gentle-spirited that its young-ladylikeness
has been proclaimed in its name. Of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
foreign species of cranes, it is the one easiest to procure,
and the most satisfactory to keep in collections. It never
quarrels, it is very sociable in its habits, and thrives in
captivity.</p>

<h2>SECTION III.&mdash;THE REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS.</h2>
<h3 id="c44">THE REPTILE HOUSE, No. 34.</h3>
<p>The Reptile House was the first large building erected in
the Zoological Park. It represents an earnest effort to present
carefully selected examples of the reptilian Orders, in a
manner which may afford the visitor and the student a general
view of the important groups of living reptiles.</p>
<p>The length of the Reptile House, over all, is 146 feet, and
its greatest width is 100 feet. It is constructed of buff mottled
brick, combined with granite and Indiana limestone.
In the ornamental cornice of terra cotta, reptilian forms
modelled by Mr. A. Phimister Proctor, the well-known animal
sculptor, constitute an important feature. The building
is roofed with slate, heated by hot water, and cost, with
its cages, about $50,000. It is beautifully situated on the
edge of a forest of primeval oaks, very near the geographical
center of the Park.</p>
<p>The great center hall is unbroken by a single column, and
at one end it opens across the Crocodile Pool and its sandbanks,
through three huge arches, into the green, jungly
mass of the conservatory. Of the tropical vegetation
massed behind the pool&mdash;palmettoes, bayonet cacti, yuccas,
and the like, and the tillandsias, Spanish moss, resurrection
ferns, and butterfly orchids,&mdash;nearly the whole came from
Florida, along with five alligators which were the first
occupants of the pool.</p>
<p>In effect, the central hall appears to be 115 feet in length,
by 40 feet wide, exclusive of the cages. But, large as this
building is, it would be an easy matter to fill all its available
space with the reptiles of North America alone, choosing
only the handsome and showy forms. As we contemplate
the great number of species in our own reptilian
fauna, the thought occurs, what can we do with the reptiles
of the Old World? Manifestly, the only proper course
is to choose from the reptiles of the world the forms which
will make for our visitors and students the most instructive
and attractive series of important types.</p>

<h3 id="c45">THE TURTLES AND TORTOISES.</h3>
<p><b>The Order of Turtles</b>, (<i>Chelonia</i>), is so large that it has
been found necessary to devote to its representatives the
whole central space of the main hall of the Reptile House,
and also a specially designed Tortoise House of glass in the
eastern end of the building. In the main hall are two features&mdash;one,
a large square tank for large turtles; the other,
a pool of running water between banks of earth, sand, and
living plants. This tank is 35 feet in length, and by means
of low, plate-glass partitions it is divided into ten cross sections,
each of which can very comfortably provide for the
wants of at least three species of turtles of medium size.
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
With a wonderfully rich Chelonian fauna on the western
continent to provide for, there is little room to spare for
Old World forms, and the temptation to make this collection
strictly Occidental, is almost too great to be resisted.
For the sake of brevity and clearness, only six types have
been chosen for special mention.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig116">
<img src="images/pmg123.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" />
<p class="pcap">GIANT TORTOISE.</p>
</div>
<p>The following species taken together fairly represent the
different forms of Chelonians, from the highest to the lowest:</p>
<p><b>The Alligator Turtle</b>, (<i>Macrochelys lacertina</i>), is the largest
fresh-water chelonian in North America. In form and
temper it resembles the common snapping turtle of the
North, and its home is in the Gulf States. The largest of
the two Louisiana specimens on exhibition weighs 115
pounds.</p>
<p><b>The Snapping Turtle</b>, (<i>Chelydra serpentina</i>), which is the
most courageous and pugnacious of all turtles, is rather
poorly protected by its shell, and must therefore fight for its
place in nature.</p>
<p><b>The Painted Turtle</b>, (<i>Chrysemys picta</i>), is a species of
wide and common distribution, and fairly representative of
the host of fresh water terrapins and turtles so common
throughout the United States in ponds and streams of all
sorts.</p>
<p><b>The Box Tortoise</b>, (<i>Cistudo carolina</i>), lives on land, and as
a means of perfect protection has been enabled by nature
completely to withdraw its head and legs within its shell,
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
and by means of a hinge across the middle of the plastron,
or lower shell, to close it tightly.</p>
<p><b>The Tortoise and Lizard Yards.</b>&mdash;At the eastern end of the
Reptile House is a commodious glass-roofed hall, opening
into a series of sandy yards. This installation is occupied
by the collection of tortoises and the larger tropical lizards.
These reptiles do better in captivity, and show to best advantage,
if given outdoor sunlight and plenty of room for
exercise.</p>
<p><b>The Giant Tortoises</b> are among the most interesting of
living reptiles. There are fourteen distinct species, all belonging
to the genus <i>Testudo</i>. These creatures appear to be
survivors of the reptilian ages when reptiles attained colossal
proportions. Fossil remains of the great tortoises show
these creatures to have formerly inhabited the continents,
but the survivors are restricted to isolated groups of small
islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Six species inhabit
the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Four are found
in the Aldabra Islands in the Indian Ocean, and four inhabit
the Mauritius-Rodriguez group of Islands. All the
species are rapidly becoming extinct. Recent expeditions
to the Galapagos Islands have reported that very few Giant
Tortoises now survive in those islands.</p>
<p>The Giant Tortoises are entirely herbivorous. The specimens
exhibited consume great quantities of green food,
which varies in kind according to the season&rsquo;s supply. During
the summer months they feed largely upon melons.</p>
<p>Among the species exhibited is <i>Testudo vicina</i>, represented
by our largest specimen, captured in the Galapagos
Islands. It weighs slightly over two hundred and twenty-five
pounds. Another example from the same islands represents
<i>Testudo nigrita</i>, a smaller and flatter species. <i>Testudo
elephantina</i>, the Elephant Tortoise, is represented by a large
specimen from the Aldabra Islands, which is growing
rapidly. The latter tortoise has a very high shell, and proportionately
small head.</p>
<p><b>The Gopher Tortoises</b>, (<i>Testudo carolina</i>), are large, thick-shelled,
clumsy creatures, which burrow in holes in the
sandy southern regions where they live. Once they were
common in southern Florida, but their edibility has resulted
in a great decrease in their abundance.</p>
<p><b>The South American Tortoise</b>, (<i>Testudo tabulata</i>), is a
good representative of the smaller tortoises from various
parts of the world. It is common throughout tropical
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
South America and attains a maximum length of shell of
about 14 inches. The shell is elongated and blackish, each
of the shields having a yellowish center. Like all of the
tortoises, this is a herbivorous reptile.</p>
<p><b>The Marine Turtles.</b>&mdash;At the New York Aquarium, situated
in Battery Park, and managed by the New York
Zoological Society, will be found a fine collection of such
large sea-turtles as the <b>Loggerhead</b>, <b>Green Turtle</b> and
<b>Hawksbill</b>, which require salt water.</p>
<p><b>The Soft-Shelled Turtle</b>, (<i>Aspidonectes ferox</i>).&mdash;As to living
relatives, this strange genus seems apropos of nothing.
Like some of the marine turtles its shell is greatly reduced
in weight, so that it can float more readily; instead of being
solid bone, it terminates in a wide, thin edge of cartilage,
which is so soft that when properly boiled it constitutes
palatable food.</p>
<h3 id="c46">THE CROCODILES AND ALLIGATORS.</h3>
<p><b>The Order of Crocodilians.</b>&mdash;This important Order, the
members of which are widely distributed throughout the
tropics and sub-tropics of the world, contains nineteen
species. At this point it is well to correct certain very
general misapprehensions regarding crocodilians.</p>
<p>Crocodiles are <i>not</i> confined to the Old World; at least
three species being found abundantly in tropical America.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;movement&rdquo; of a crocodile&rsquo;s jaw differs in no manner
whatever from that of an alligator.</p>
<p>Only a few species of crocodiles are dangerous to man.</p>
<p>There is no authentic record of the loss of a human life
through our common alligator.</p>
<p>The <b>Alligator</b> genus embraces the <b>American Alligator</b>,
(<i>A. mississippiensis</i>), of the southern United States and a
small species found in China! The head of the Alligator is
very flat and its sides are nearly parallel, while the head of
a typical crocodile is nearly triangular.</p>
<p>The American Alligator is well represented in the Pool in
the Reptile House, by several lusty specimens, all of which
eat voraciously, are growing rapidly, and undoubtedly enjoying
life. The largest specimen, a burly monster over
twelve feet in length, has grown nearly five feet in length
since its arrival here in 1899.</p>
<p>In summer, the Alligator Pool on the hill, southeast of the
Reptile House, is well stocked with alligators of various
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
sizes, and it is there that visitors can secure most realistic
impressions of the appearance of this species in a state of
nature, and in abundant numbers.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig117">
<img src="images/pmg124.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="504" />
<p class="pcap">ALLIGATOR POOL.</p>
</div>
<p>Under favorable conditions,&mdash;warm water and air, good
light, plenty of room, and abundant food,&mdash;the Alligator
grows rapidly. A specimen hatched in our Reptile House
in October, 1900, was in January, 1911, 8 feet 3 inches long,
and weighed 75 pounds.</p>
<p>The <b>Crocodile</b> genus is widely represented throughout the
world. Of the whole eleven species, the American continent
contains four&mdash;the <b>Florida Crocodile</b>, (<i>Crocodilus
acutus floridanus</i>), attaining a length of 14 feet, which was
discovered at the head of Biscayne Bay, in 1875, by W. T.
Hornaday; the <b>American Crocodile</b>, (<i>C. acutus</i>); the <b>Sharp-nosed
Orinoco Crocodile</b> (<i>Crocodilus intermedius</i>), found in
South America; and the small <i>Crocodilus rhombifer</i>, which
is found only in Cuba and the West Indies.</p>
<p>Of the seven remaining species, Asia contains four, and
Africa three. Of the Asiatic species, one frequents salt
water.</p>
<p><b>The Florida Crocodile</b> is now represented by two specimens
nearly 9 feet long, from Madina Creek, southern Florida,
presented by Mr. Julian A. Dimock. It is to be recognized
at a glance by its dark olive color and sharp-pointed
head. This is the only species of crocodile found in the
United States. Its maximum length is 14 feet 2 inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<div class="img" id="fig118">
<img src="images/pmg125.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="398" />
<p class="pcap">VENEZUELAN BOA.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Broad-Nosed Crocodile</b>, (<i>Osteolaemus tetraspis</i>), of
Africa, is represented by two specimens. This species is
characterized by the broad, bony-looking head. It is one of
the smaller crocodilians attaining a maximum length of five
feet.</p>
<h3 id="c47">THE LIZARDS.</h3>
<p><b>The Tropical Lizards.</b>&mdash;Several families of lizards are
represented among the specimens occupying the Reptile
House, the Tortoise room and outside runways. Among
these are the <b>Iguanas, Tegus and Monitors</b>.</p>
<p>Among the <b>Iguanas</b> are several large and interesting lizards.
The largest of these is the <b>Rhinoceros Iguana</b>, (<i>Cyclura
cornuta</i>), found in Hayti. Contrary to the general
belief, but like all the Iguanas, it is partly carnivorous,
though it feeds largely upon vegetables and fruit. This
species receives its name from the presence of three well-defined
horns upon the snout.</p>
<p><b>The Mexican Iguana</b>, (<i>Ctenosaura acanthura</i>), looks
unique in the possession of rings of sharp spines about the
tail. Most specimens are jet black when adult, but very
young examples are pale green.</p>
<p><b>The South American Iguana</b>, (<i>Iguana tuberculata</i>), may be
readily distinguished by the very pronounced fringe of
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
erect spines which rise along the back-bone of male specimens,
and also by the presence of a rounded tubercle or
plate on each side of the head. This is a brightly colored
Iguana, having bars of green, gray and black. It is strictly
arboreal, and evinces stronger herbivorous habits than species
of the allied genera. A large male specimen is seven
feet long, but much of this length is taken up by the gradually
tapering tail. In South America&mdash;on the Orinoco, at
least&mdash;this species is considered edible, and the writer can
testify that to a hungry man its flesh is excellent.</p>
<p>The very popular <b>Horned &ldquo;Toad&rdquo;</b>, (<i>Phrynosoma</i>), of the
southwestern states, of which there are eight or nine species,
should be mentioned if for no other reason than to place
it where it belongs&mdash;with the lizards, and not with the
toads.</p>
<p><b>The Tegus</b>, (genus <i>Tupinambis</i>), are powerful lizards,
growing to a length of four feet, and inhabiting tropical
South America. They are fleet of foot, mainly carnivorous
and very quarrelsome. It is impossible to keep any but the
larger lizards in the yard with them. Tegus are fond of
eggs, breaking the shell at one end and lapping up the contents
by means of the very broad, forked tongue. They will
also eat raw beef.</p>
<p><b>The Australian Monitor</b>, (<i>Varanus gouldii</i>), is a good representative
of a genus of large and powerful lizards confined
to the Old World, where they occur in India, Malaysia,
Africa and Australia. Monitors grow to a length of eight
feet. They are swift runners, entirely carnivorous, and
usually dwell in thick jungles. They are able to swallow
entire an animal as large as a half-grown rabbit. All are
fond of eggs, swallowing them without breaking the shell,
which is soon dissolved by the powerful gastric juices.</p>
<p><b>Other Lizards.</b>&mdash;Within the main halls of the Reptile
House will be found various representatives of the smaller
Lizards, a few of which may be mentioned.</p>
<p>The beautiful, emerald-colored <b>Green Lizard</b>, (<i>Lacerta
viridis</i>), of Europe, is not only a handsome species, but it is
also one of the most satisfactory to keep in a vivarium&mdash;a
good feeder and always posing.</p>
<p>The famous <b>Glass &ldquo;Snake,&rdquo;</b> (<i>Ophiosauris ventralis</i>), is important
because its resemblance to a snake is so perfect
it is generally mistaken for one, although a true lizard. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
is not, however, a &ldquo;connecting link&rdquo; between the lizards
and the serpents.</p>
<p>Our well-known <b>Gila Monster</b>, (pronounced <i>He</i>-la) (<i>Heloderma
suspectum</i>), is a stupid, slow-moving creature from the
southwestern deserts, thick-set and stumpy in body, and it
has the appearance of being covered all over with dark-brown-black,
and yellow beads, such as Indians use in their
bead industry. Its bite is sufficiently venomous that it inflicts
a painful wound, but it is not necessarily fatal.</p>
<p>The <b>Chameleon</b> of the Old World, (<i>Chamaeleo vulgaris</i>),
because of its color phases and its remarkable form, is truly
a great &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo;; but it should not be confused with our
so-called American Chameleon, which belongs to another
Family, and is also less interesting.</p>
<h3 id="c48">THE SERPENTS.</h3>
<p><b>The Order of Serpents</b>, (<i>Ophidia</i>).&mdash;The large glazed
cases along the northern side of the main hall of the Reptile
House are devoted to the larger serpents, while the smaller
species are provided for along the south wall, and in the
adjoining room. One serious difficulty in the management of
a collection of living serpents lies in the fact that often the
most valuable specimens are so nervous and shy in their
feeding habits it is impossible to cage several together.</p>
<p>Out of the many species of serpents exhibited in the Reptile
House, ten are chosen as fairly representing the principal
groups.</p>
<p><b>The Regal Python</b>, (<i>Python reticulatus</i>), here represented
by a fine specimen, 22 feet in length, weighing 170 pounds,
is the best representative of the rock pythons of Asia and
Africa. The island of Borneo is its center of distribution.
None of the constrictors is venomous, but their crushing
power is almost beyond belief.</p>
<p><b>The Rock Python</b>, (<i>Python sebae</i>), of Africa, is a light-colored
species with a very small head, and is frequently
seen in the hands and around the necks of snake-charmers.</p>
<p><b>The Anaconda</b>, (<i>Eunectes murinus</i>), is one of the largest
constrictors of tropical America, and is noted for its aquatic
habits. It is a handsome serpent, being of a rich green
color, marked with large black spots.</p>
<p><b>The Black Snake</b>, (<i>Bascanium constrictor</i>), a common species
in the eastern United States, is probably the highest
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
type of the harmless snakes. It is a serpent of great vigor
and activity in running, climbing, and swimming; it possesses
great courage, and seeks prey of many kinds in all
kinds of situations.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig119">
<img src="images/pmg126.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" />
<p class="pcap">RHINOCEROS VIPER.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Garter Snake</b>, (<i>Eutaenia sirtalis</i>), is more frequently
seen in the eastern United States than any other serpent.
Although the warfare waged against it is perpetual, regardless
of the fact that it is as harmless as a fly, its numbers do
not sensibly diminish.</p>
<p><b>The Hog-Nosed Snake, &ldquo;Puff Adder,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sand-Viper,&rdquo;</b>
(<i>Heterodon platyrhinus</i>), represents a large and important
Family, and, despite its dangerous appearance and terrifying
names, it is quite harmless. It represents one of Nature&rsquo;s
methods for protecting harmless and inactive creatures,
by making them resemble others which are dangerous.</p>
<p><b>Venomous Reptiles.</b>&mdash;Because of the number of species
of rattlesnakes which have found lodgment in the United
States, and the trouble they have caused in a few localities,
we are specially interested in all serpents which are dangerous
to man. The species named below represents the deadly
genera which civilized man has most cause to fear.</p>
<p><b>The Harlequin Snake, or Coral Snake</b>, (<i>Elaps fulvius</i>),
represents a genus which contains many species, though but
few of them occur in America.</p>
<p><b>The King Cobra</b>, (<i>Naja bungaris</i>), from the Malay Peninsula,
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
often called <b>Snake-Eating Cobra</b>, is the most dangerous
of all serpents, because it is the largest and the most athletic
of the venomous species, and for its bite there is no
effective antidote. It feeds only on living snakes. The fine
specimen exhibited is about ten feet in length.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig120">
<img src="images/pmg127.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="395" />
<p class="pcap">COBRA-DE-CAPELLO.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Cobra-de-Capello</b>, (<i>Naja tripudians</i>), of which some
fine specimens are shown, is the terror of India, where it
kills between 18,000 and 20,000 people annually! This
is the most deadly of all serpents. For its bite, science has
thus far been powerless to find an antidote, although Dr.
Albert Calmette, of Lille, France, experimenting extensively
in this direction, has secured partially successful results.</p>
<p>The most vicious snake in North America, and one of
the ugliest in appearance, is the <b>Water Moccasin</b>, (<i>Ancistrodon
piscivorus</i>),&mdash;closely related to the beautiful <b>Copperhead</b>,
(<i>A. contortrix</i>). It is more dreaded in the South than
the rattler, because it strikes on the slightest provocation,
and without the rattler&rsquo;s timely warning. Its colors are
dull, its scales rough, its body ill-shaped and clumsy, its
temper is vicious, and for every reason it is a serpent to be
disliked.</p>
<p><b>The Diamond-Back Rattlesnake</b>, (<i>Crotalus adamanteus</i>), is
too handsome, too showy, and too large to be chosen as the
best average type of the genus <i>Crotalus</i>; but he is king of
his kind, and cannot be ignored. Three species shown side
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
by side in our Reptile House afford striking examples of
protective coloration. The Diamond-Back Rattler of Florida
and the South is yellow, brown, and black, to match the
checkers of sunbeam and shadow that fall upon the sands
under the palmetto leaves.</p>
<h3 id="c49">THE BATRACHIANS, OR AMPHIBIANS.</h3>
<p>Among the many wonders of Nature, none is more interesting
than those forms which serve to connect the great
groups of vertebrate animals, by bridging over what otherwise
would seem like impassable chasms.</p>
<p>Between the birds and the reptiles there is a fossil bird,
called the Arch&aelig;opteryx, with a long, vertebrated, lizard-like
tail, which is covered with feathers, and the Hesperornis,
a water bird with teeth, but no wings, which inhabited the
shores of the great western lake which has already yielded
to American paleontologists a great number of most remarkable
fossil forms.</p>
<p>Between the reptiles and the fishes, stretches a wonderful
chain of living links by which those two Classes of vertebrates
are so closely and unbrokenly united, and by such
an array of forms, that they constitute an independent Class,
the Batrachia, or Amphibia. In the transition from water
to land, from fins and gills to legs and lungs, Nature has
made some strange combinations. In some instances the
fins, legs, lungs and gills have become so mixed that several
notable misfits have resulted, and in some cases we see gills
and legs going together, while in other lungs and fins are
associated.</p>
<p>The Reptile House contains about two dozen species of
Amphibians, and it is reasonably certain that this number
will be maintained and increased. They are to be found
in small aquarium cases, ranged along the south side and
eastern end of the Main Hall.</p>
<p><b>The Bullfrog</b>, (<i>Rana catesbiana</i>), is a fair representative
of the Batrachians which stand nearest to the true land-going
reptiles. During the early stages of its existence it is
in turn, a fin-tailed tadpole with no legs, a short-tailed tadpole
with a pair of front legs, a shorter-tailed tadpole with
four legs, and finally a fully-developed, land-going frog
with a voice like a small bull, and no tail whatever. Of the
genus <i>Rana</i>, there are five species in the eastern United
States, several of which inhabit the Zoological Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p><b>The Wood Frog</b>, (<i>Rana sylvatica</i>), is frequently seen in
moist valleys in the Zoological Park, where its chocolate
brown back so closely matches the color of the dead leaves
and moist earth; it is difficult to find, save when it takes one
of its flying leaps. The specimens shown were taken near
the Beaver Pond.</p>
<p><b>The Tree Frog</b>, (<i>Hyla pickeringi</i>), is the commonest of
the queer little tree-loving species which are so easy to hear,
and so difficult to find. In spring their voices are the first
to be heard in the swamps. The Zoological Park is full of
<i>Hylas</i>, and their cheerful piping is heard at all seasons,
especially in dry midsummer, when dark storm-clouds
gather and promise rain.</p>
<p><b>The Common Toad</b>, (<i>Bufo lentiginosus</i>), is found in the
Zoological Park, though not in such abundance as the two
preceding species.</p>
<p>Among the most remarkable creatures in the Reptile
House are the specimens of <b>Smooth-Clawed Frog</b>, (<i>Xenopus
laevis</i>), from Africa and <b>The Surinam Toad</b>, (<i>Pipa americana</i>).
Both of these species are strictly aquatic and have broadly
palmated hind feet. The Surinam Toad comes from Dutch
Guiana. It is unique in its breeding habits. The male collects
the eggs and places them on the female&rsquo;s back where
they are engulfed in large folds of the skin, which form
cells in which the metamorphosis occurs.</p>
<p><b>The Spotted Salamander</b>, (<i>Salamandra maculosa</i>), because
of its broad, bright yellow bands and blotches, laid on a
rich, dark-brown body color, is one of the most showy of all
Amphibians. It comes from Europe, and being much prized
in collections, it frequently passes through the hands of
dealers in reptiles. Its skin is very moist and clammy,
which gives the creature the appearance of having been
varnished. This is the creature which is supposed to be
able to withstand fire&mdash;a belief which is purely imaginative.</p>
<p><b>The Tiger Salamander or Axolotl</b>, (<i>Amblystoma tigrinum</i>),
is a widely different creature from the preceding. It is
found throughout the greater portion of the North American
continent, and as far south as Central Mexico. Thirteen
other species of the genus <i>Amblystoma</i> are found in
North America and Mexico. In the matter of &ldquo;harmonizing
with environment,&rdquo; the <i>Amblystoma</i> is one of the most
remarkable creatures in existence. In its larval stage
(corresponding with the tadpole stage of a frog), this animal

possesses external gills, red and sponge-like in appearance,
and its tail has a fin-like edge above and below, like
the tail of an eel.</p>

<p>So long as this larval creature remains in water, its external
gills remain and do duty, and the larval stage continues
indefinitely. Remove it from water, or let its home
pool dry up, and, presto! its gills dry up, its tail loses its
fin-like edges, and the creature goes about on land, breathing
air instead of water, with lungs instead of gills.</p>
<p><b>The &ldquo;Water-Dog&rdquo;</b> or &ldquo;<b>Hellbender</b>,&rdquo; (<i>Cryptobranchus
allegheniensis</i>), is a salamander-like amphibian, from 18 to 22
inches long when adult, found more frequently in Pennsylvania
than elsewhere. They are said to be very tenacious
of life, and voracious in their food habits, feeding on
worms, minnows and crayfish, and often taking the hook of
the fisherman in quest of that most repulsive of all American
fishes, the cat-fish. Between cat-fish and water-dog
there would seem to be small choice. Mr. William Frear
offers this testimony in regard to the tenacity of life of this
creature:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One specimen, about 18 inches in length, which had lain
on the ground exposed to a summer sun for 48 hours, was
brought to the museum, and left lying a day longer before
it was placed in alcohol. The day following, desiring to
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
note a few points of structure, I removed it from the alcohol
in which it had been completely submerged for at least
20 hours, and had no sooner placed in on the table than it
began to open its big mouth, vigorously sway its tail to and
fro, and give other undoubted signs of vitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Congo Snake</b>, or <b>Amphiuma</b>, (<i>Amphiuma means</i>), is
a creature which closely resembles a thick-tailed snake.
A close examination, however, discloses a tiny pair of front
legs; and far back, well toward the end of the tail, a small
pair of hind legs appear. These are about as valuable to
the animal as the tiger&rsquo;s clavicle is to him. There are but
two species belonging to this strange genus, both of which
are found in the stagnant waters of our southeastern states.
Still lower than the amphiuma, is <b>The Mud Eel</b>, (<i>Siren lacertina</i>),
of the southeastern quarter of the United States,
which possesses small external gills, and only one pair of
legs, which are in front.</p>
<p><b>The Menobranchus</b>, or <b>Mud Puppy</b>, (<i>Necturus maculatus</i>),
possesses external gills and four legs, and inhabits many of
the rivers of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, the great lakes
and also the lakes of northern New York. It is often taken
in fisherman&rsquo;s nets.</p>
<h2>SECTION IV.&mdash; THE INSECTS.</h2>
<h3 id="c50">THE INSECT COLLECTION.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></h3>
<p>A collection of insects was formed and placed on exhibition
during the early summer of 1910. While this first
exhibit was not elaborate, it excited such interest that it
was decided to enlarge it, by taking advantage of the season
which then was at its best for insect collecting.</p>
<p>A series of long shelves has been built in the Pavilion
between the Small-Mammal House and the Ostrich House,
and thirty-five glass-fronted cages, together with a row of
aquaria for aquatic specimens, were installed. A number
of collecting trips were made into the country within a
radius of twenty-five miles of the city, with such marked
success, that by the middle of July the collection was pronounced
by a number of visitors to equal in interest any
exhibition of the kind heretofore attempted in this country,
or in Europe. In view of the marked interest created by
this display, the insect collection will hereafter be a permanent
feature of the Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>

<p class="pcap">GIANT CENTIPEDE.</p>
</div>
<p>There are so many possibilities in exhibiting living insects
that it is difficult to select groups to feature for the
summer. Our efforts were first directed toward exhibiting a
series of the different insects that sing, and also a series
of species injurious to the interests of the agriculturists,
together with a number of the insects that prey upon the
noxious species. The collection of singing insects was a
marked success and will hereafter be continued each summer.</p>
<p>We are gathering from both the Old World and the New,
a fine collection of the larger silk moths. The cocoons will
be shown on panels, and inasmuch as a number of the
moths will be emerging daily, this exhibit should be instructive.
During the winter the insect collection is made up
largely of tropical species; and in this series we include the
large bird-killing spiders, scorpions and centipedes, even
though these creatures are not to be classified as true insects.</p>
<p>The collection of singing insects of the past summer was
composed of the meadow locust, greater and lesser cone-headed
locust, the Katy-did, broad-winged locust, field
cricket, lesser field cricket, smooth-winged cricket and two
species of the tree crickets. There were about five hundred
specimens in the collection, and at times the noise made
by them was so great that visitors had to shout to one another
to make their own voices audible. The sounds coming
from this collection varied according to the time of day.
It was late in the afternoon, when the larger locusts commenced
their singing (which continued throughout the
night), and inasmuch as the strictly diurnal species were yet
active, the insect chorus was quite vociferous.</p>
<p>It is only with considerable difficulty that singing insects
are collected. The best time to capture them is at
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
night, when the collector stalks the loudest singers, and by
approaching within definite investigating distance, can accurately
locate the insects by bringing into use an electric
flash-lamp. The glare of the light usually causes the insect
to stop its calls, but it remains motionless upon a branch or
leaf and may be grasped with a delicate pair of forceps,
provided the movements of the collector&rsquo;s arm are performed
outside the rays of light. If the locust has become silent
and cannot be detected when the light is thrown upon it,
the collector simply switches off the light and remains
quiet. In a few minutes the creature continues its song,
when its exact location is again determined. In this way
the night songsters of a big meadow are collected, one by
one, and the collector leaves behind him a silent field that a
few hours before resounded with the stridulations of the
insect chorus.</p>

<p>Among the more interesting insects exhibited, in our
series are to be found the walking-stick, the praying mantis,
the huge red-winged locust of the South, the Egyptian
scarab, the luminous beetle of Central and South America,
and broods of silk worm. The life history of the mosquito
will be permanently illustrated in a series of tanks, and adjoining
these an exhibit of natural enemies of these pests.</p>
<p>The insect collection is supplied with interesting descriptive
labels. During the latter part of spring it is removed
from the Reptile House, where, during the winter the number
of its cages are much reduced, and replaced in the
quarters occupied during the summer.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
